Model Y to once again be the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally for the full year 2024,
and we have made it even better, with the New Model Y now launched in all markets. In 2024,
we made significant investments in infrastructure that will spur the next wave of growth for the
company, including vehicle manufacturing capabilities for new models, AI training compute and
energy storage manufacturing capacity.
Affordability remains top of mind for customers, and we continue to review every aspect of our
cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle5 to help alleviate this concern. In Q4, COGS per vehicle
reached its lowest level ever at <$35,000, driven largely by raw material cost improvement,
helping us to partially offset our investment in compelling financing and lease options.
The Energy business achieved another record in Q4 with its highest-ever gross profit
generation. Construction of Megafactory Shanghai was completed in December and will begin
ramping this quarter. Powerwall deployments achieved another record quarter as we continue
to ramp Powerwall 3 production and launch in additional markets.
2025 will be a seminal year in Tesla’s history as FSD (Supervised) continues to rapidly improve
with the aim of ultimately exceeding human levels of safety. This will eventually unlock an
unsupervised FSD option for our customers and the Robotaxi business, which we expect to
begin launching later this year in parts of the U.S. We also continue to work on launching FSD
(Supervised) in Europe and China in 2025.

emissions requirements.
Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle5 came down to its lowest level ever at ~$35,100.
In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to
make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile
competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering
of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the
first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal
of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car
ownership and even public transit.
The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin.
Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and
Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to
ramp Powerwall 3.
Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments,
we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and

saw a sequential rebound in vehicle deliveries in Q2 as overall consumer sentiment improved
and we launched attractive financing options to offset the impact of sustained high interest
rates. We recognized record regulatory credit revenues in Q2 as other OEMs are still behind on
meeting emissions requirements.
Global EV penetration returned to growth in Q2 and is taking share from ICE vehicles. We
believe that a pure EV is the optimal vehicle design and will ultimately win over consumers as
the myths on range, charging and service are debunked.
Progress continued for our AI initiatives in Q2. We reduced the price of FSD (Supervised)4 in
North America and launched free trials to everyone with the necessary hardware. These
programs have demonstrated success and are laying the foundation for more meaningful FSD
monetization. We expect to see an increase in FSD attach rates for our fleet as the capability
improves and we increase awareness of the convenience and safety it offers users.
Overall, our focus remains on company-wide cost reduction, including reducing COGS per
vehicle, growing our traditional hardware business and accelerating development of our AI-
enabled products and services. Though timing of Robotaxi deployment depends on
technological advancement and regulatory approval, we are working vigorously on this
opportunity given the outsized potential value. Concurrently, we are managing our product
portfolio with a long-term orientation and focusing on growing sales, maximizing our installed
base and generating sufficient cash flow to invest in future growth.

Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids
over EVs. While positive for our regulatory credits business, we prefer the industry
to continue pushing EV adoption, which is in-line with our mission. To support our
growth, we have been increasing awareness and expanding vehicle financing
programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.
While many are pulling back on their investments, we are investing in future growth
– including our AI infrastructure, production capacity, our Supercharger and service
networks and new products infrastructure – with $2.8B of capital expenditures in
Q1.
We recently undertook a cost-cutting exercise to increase operational efficiency.
We also remain committed to company-wide cost reduction, including reducing
COGS per vehicle. Ultimately, we are focused on profitable growth, including by
leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more
affordable products.
The future is not only electric, but also autonomous. We believe scaled autonomy is
only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster.
We have, and continue to expand, both. To make FSD (Supervised) 5 more

SUMMARY

The third quarter of 2022 was another strong quarter with record revenue,
operating profit and free cash flow. In the last 12 months, our free cash flow
exceeded $8.9B. Our operating margin reached 17.2% in Q3.

We achieved an industry-leading operating margin? while encountering
material headwinds YoY. Raw material cost inflation impacted our
profitability along with ramp inefficiencies from Gigafactory Berlin-
Brandenburg, Gigafactory Texas and 4680 cell production. Also, the U.S.
Dollar (USD) continued to strengthen compared to all other major
currencies in our markets.

Additionally, as illustrated on page 21, we are reaching such significant
delivery volumes in the final weeks of each quarter that transportation
capacity is becoming expensive and difficult to secure. As a result, we
began transitioning to a smoother delivery pace, leading to more vehicles
in transit at the end of the quarter. We expect that smoothing our
outbound logistics throughout the quarter will improve cost per vehicle.

We remain focused on increasing vehicle production as quickly as possible,
by increasing our weekly build rate in Fremont and Shanghai and
progressing steadily through the production ramps in Berlin and Texas.
Logistics volatility and supply chain bottlenecks remain immediate
challenges, although improving. We continue to believe that battery supply
chain constraints will be the main limiting factor to EV market growth in
the medium and long terms. Despite these challenges, we expect to
continue to deliver every vehicle produced while maintaining strong
operating margins.

Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages
and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team,
including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked
extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as
possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component
supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for
the rest of this year.

We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible
due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source
a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult
engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be
solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cutting-
edge AI.
Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a
never-before-seen inflection point. We continue to work hard to drive
down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles
accessible to as many people as possible.

increased sequentially, as our costs decreased even faster. Reducing the
average cost of the vehicles we produce is essential to our mission. In
2017, as we began production of Model 3, our average cost per vehicle
across the fleet was ~$84,000. Due to the launch of new products and
new factories and the reduced mix of Model S and Model X, our average
cost declined to sub-$38,000 per vehicle in Q1.
Q1
About three and a half years into its production, and even without a
European factory, Model 3 was the best-selling premium sedan in the
world,3 outselling long-time industry leaders such as the 3 Series and E-
Class. This demonstrates that an electric vehicle can be a category
leader and outsell its gas-powered counterparts. We believe Model Y
can become not just a category leader, but also the best-selling vehicle
of any kind globally.
First deliveries of the new Model S should start very shortly, Model Y
production rate in Shanghai continues to improve quickly and two new
factories Berlin and Texas are making progress. There is a lot to be

margin (despite an increase of SBC to $1.7B). Teams across our
organization, including supply chain, manufacturing, logistics and
delivery, rose to the occasion to ensure strong execution.
In addition, we continued to improve our products and make progress
on our long-term roadmap. We ramped Model 3 in China to over 5,000
in Q4 cars per week and started production of Model Y at Gigafactory
Shanghai less than a year after breaking ground on the expansion. We
also launched and ramped Model Y in Fremont in 2020.
In Berlin and Austin, we remain on track to start vehicle production this
year with structural batteries leveraging in-house battery cells. Our
engineering team has made significant progress on Full Self Driving
(FSD) software, with a limited release to customers. Finally, we are
excited to ramp the updated Model S and Model X and deliver our first
Tesla Semi by the end of the year.

SUMMARY

Q1 2020 was the first time in our history that we achieved a positive
GAAP net income in the seasonally weak first quarter. Despite global
operational challenges, we were able to achieve our best first quarter for
both production and deliveries.

Although impacted by inefficiencies related to the temporary suspension
of production and deliveries in many locations, our gross margin
remained strong. At Gigafactory Shanghai, further volume growth
resulted in a material improvement in margins of locally made Model 3
vehicles. In addition, Model Y contributed profits, which is the first time
in our history that a new product has been profitable in its first quarter.

Despite the expiration of various government incentives at the end of
last year, Ql was pacing to be the strongest quarter of deliveries until
our operations were interrupted in March. As a result, we remain
confident in growing global production capacity as quickly as possible.
We are continuing to significantly invest in our product roadmap,
including improvements in technology, as well as localizing production
in Shanghai and Berlin.

At the same time, we are diligently managing working capital, reducing
non-critical soend, and driving productivity improvements. We believe
we are well-positioned to manage near-term uncertainty while achieving
our long-term plans.
