1. They don't have any moat. Hence the margins are limited. Moreso, their main competitors are also the companies manufacturing the cells, so their incentive will be to sell their own packaged solutions first.

2. Factories are incredibly quick  to put together. Case in point, Shanghai.

3. There's no customer stickiness. Projects get put up and companies bid on them. Tesla can't bring much to the party and if the market shrinks / offer grows too much, their margins will be the first ones to be squeezed. 

4. Investors are making the same mistake they did with cars. Projecting today's growth rates too far into the future. Remember 20m by 2030? They're still struggling to get over 2m.

Things have to be put into context: you go in every Tesla group and everyone has been waiting for Model Y Juniper for months, thatâ€™s why they havenâ€™t bought a Tesla YET.

The moment they release the new Model Y sales are going to skyrocket, making up for the sales they didnâ€™t get in 2024.

A newer design alone is a huge factor when buying a new car, you buy a Model Y now and you get a 2020 car, you buy a Model Y in a couple months and you get a 2025 car, so itâ€™s worth the wait considering there isnâ€™t going to be any noticeable price difference.

Plus, people were not expecting it to take so long to come out, thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ve been waiting, they were all hoping for it to be released this summer, then October, then pictures started popping up and everyone knew it was coming soon, so they ENDED UP waiting for almost a year.

Still, the moment it gets released theyâ€™re going to get (worldwide) tens of thousands of orders in a matter of hours.

-1.07% in 2024 despite not releasing any new car (other than the Model 3 Performance) is really not that bad.

post,"Cybertruck incident
It'll be interesting to see over the coming days what really happened here. There's an awful lot of speculation, but something doesn't smell right with the narrative being presented. 

What if the person wanted to go on a roadtrip from Colorado to Vegas, got some fireworks to set off in the desert for New Year's and had some fuel with them for camping equipment? Maybe they rented the cybertruck because they are in love with Elon at the moment and they planned to stay at the trump hotel for the same reason. Road trip from Colorado to the trump hotel then back, meanwhile you set some fireworks off in the desert, nice trip. Except the battery was one of the ones being quietly recalled that were manufactured between Feb and July of last year? 

They pull in, it starts smoking from underneath, classic lithium battery fire behavior then in the first frame of the explosion it looks like it's coming from underneath the cybertruck then the explosion triggers the fuel and fireworks, not the other way around.

I'm no expert, but let's face it, Elon can pay to make the narrative whatever he wants, but I have a feeling a whistleblower might say something about the battery issue.",1/2/2025 16:59,Ok-Abroad-2674,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hrydnu/cybertruck_incident/,0.8485,reddit

3. There is absolutely customer stickiness to a degree. They don't just build the megapacks & then drop them off. There is ongoing support and maintenance over many years, which also creates deferred revenue recognition too. Market shrinks? The opportunity and scale is vast. It won't shrink.

Deliveries are slightly (1.07%) lower than 2023 (no cars released in 2024 except for the Model 3 Performance) so everyone thinks everyoneâ€™s going to sell, so everyone sells, especially since nobody is willing to take a chance and wait for the Q4 financials.

Tesla is AT LEAST a trillion dollar company as of now, anything closer to 1.5 trillion is overvalued, despite being kinda acceptable.

It can get to 3/5/10 trillion, but not right now.

Keep in mind the S&P500 averages 10% a year, you canâ€™t expect a stock to go +10% a day forever, right now itâ€™s like 20% down after the all time high, after a +230% since April.

Longer term I think you'll be ok, but expect a very bumpy road back to $414.

It does seem to be coming into focus now that in the US and in Europe the ""Elon effect"" is indeed causing a negative impact on sales.  Esp. in the US with the incentives they are still significantly under performing.

On the plus side the cheaper model and the refreshed Model Y are likely good catalysts to move sales higher.

comment,"Tesla's stock has shown significant volatility recently, rising from $300 to $480 before correcting back to $380 today.

1. Short-term Support: Around three weeks ago, large players pushed the price from $360 to $400 with heavy trading volume. $400 has since become a strong support level, attracting retail investors who drove the price to $480. However, institutional selling near $480 suggests theyâ€™ve exited, leaving the market to retail traders. 

2. Key Support Levels: If the price falls, strong support levels are at $375, $350, $300, and $268. A drop below $300 is unlikely in the short term. 


3. Options Activity: On December 17, Tesla hit $480, but large-scale options selling worth $700M indicated institutions no longer expect short-term gains. $295 remains a strong long-term support level.

4. Future Outlook: With institutions stepping back, retail sentiment will drive volatility. Teslaâ€™s price may stabilize around $350-380 or test lower supports.

Summary: Teslaâ€™s stock is at a key point, with its stability depending on market confidence and retail activity.",1/3/2025 2:27,Maleficent_Variety_5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hojraz/jan_2/,0.978,reddit

comment,"Itâ€™s not

The thing is itâ€™s the first time Tesla sees a decrease in deliveries, and the deliveries were slightly lower than expected.

Putting things into context shows that 18,000 more deliveries would have resulted in an increase, and thereâ€™s lots of buyers waiting for Model Y Juniper.

Model Y being the most sold car and â€˜Juniperâ€™ not being released in 2024 caused this slight decrease in sales, but weâ€™re talking about less than 20k vehicles; the moment they release the new Model Y theyâ€™re getting those orders in a matter of hours/days.

Despite the thing not being a big deal it all eventually comes down to game theory: everyone made good profits > everyone thinks any minor bad news might cause everyone else to sell > the moment everyone sees bad news they all start selling because they expect everyone else to do so.

Still, not a big deal if youâ€™re in for the long term.

Based on your purchase size, I hope you can hold for the long term.  TSLA is being beat down due to delivery data.

An alternative strategy for you would have been to buy a LEAP.   Say out in Sep 25 at 20 delta.  It would be more capital efficient than buying stock but allow you to capture the long term up move.  You can also sell OTM calls to reduce your basis on whatever your favorite time frame is.

comment,"You get advising from a professional advisor. Everyone here will most likely have some type of bias if they invest in Tesla. That said, what you're really asking for is opinions on how you should spend your own money. Our comments shouldn't put you at ease and only make you think. The thinking should be done before the purchase, during the purchase, and after the sale. I'll share my opinions and give you something to think about. Anywhere in my comments you see a question mark, you should research. It is rhetorical to me, so I don't need answers. Put yourself at ease, love. 

I tell my friends and family, ""If you lose it all and can't feed yourself/family or pay your bills, then are you gambling? If you lose it all and it hurts, but your livelihood isn't at stake, then are you investing?""  When you gamble, you typically get nothing in return unless you hit the jackpot. Hitting the jackpot is rare.  When you invest, you get assest to a company in the form of notes or shares. Upon your purchase, the price typically goes up or down, and you have a choice to lose or gain, depending on your own choices. Many choices may be based on growth potential. Growth for an electric car and tech (ai, solar) company would maybe be deliveries and innovation? A person may ask themselves, ""How are their deliveries?"",  and / or ""What technology are they creating, and is it marketable?"". Some may ask, ""Are they profitable?"". I wouldn't be surprised if some are forecasting progress from the information provided in their public quarterly reports, or interviews, or press releases. Maybe all the above? Should an investor research on their own then seek outside sources to get a better understanding, especially if the numbers are confusing? 

When an organization is young, then isn't volatility a part of the growth process? Someone may ask themselves, ""Am I looking for long-term gains or short term?"". The older an organization gets, the more of a risk it may become to invest in at their all-time highs. How old is Tesla? How old are the markets Tesla is in?  

It is not often that Amazon's pop-up. Which is why we all lose something. It's ""the what"" that truly matters. Our goals are typically to put a chunk in early. The earliest we do the potentially higher our profit margin is.  A few months of hesitation can mean millions in the early stage. Speaking from experience. Can't time the highs and lows amigos. If you invest and profit in the long run, you can't lose. You only lose if you pull out with less than you put in. People waited years to see the profit they put into Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet...  The list goes on and on. But the point is, there was a point when every single one of those stocks was young and volatile. During their volatile time, there was someone who pulled out and someone who bought in. There was someone who bought too high and someone who bought low. Decide what you believe the survivability of an organization is by researching facts. Then, allow opinions to get you to search for more facts. Then, come up with a hypothesis. This hypothesis should only change if the facts change. If the facts remain the same, then why change? Start from the very beginning. Wouldn't you want to know every single thing about an organization you put your hard earned money into?

comment,"I donâ€™t think anything like this is completely out of the question for Tesla. If Elon sees a need for it, then heâ€™ll focus company efforts toward it. But I could also see the â€œtoo many cooks in the kitchenâ€ type of dynamic. Where Tesla already has FSD, vehicles, and botsâ€¦ adding a completely new product to their plate could start to become unpractical and/or spread their talent too thin. Honestly, itâ€™s probably 50/50 that they break into drones. The obvious overlap being their AI vision being utilized for autonomous drones. 

But if I had to lean one way, I could see Elon wanting to hone the bot technology first and get production rolling there before starting on something like drones.",1/4/2025 19:08,Droppin_Bombs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1htkf79/will_tesla_create_autonomous_drones/,0.9559,reddit

comment,"Miles to critical disengagement metric is not improving much. At this rate, it'll be 2125 before it gets high enough to drop the human in the car. There are clear solutions just Elon/Tesla are not willing to admit they are wrong. FSD needs to go multi-modal to consider multiple data sources in parallel. Vision is important but another source radar or lidar needs to be a redundancy backup and for cutting through heavy weather. There needs to be high quality nav data too. There's absolutely no reason it should be up to vision to pick the lane. Navigation data can also remove the lane switching problem. 

Elon just wants to be cheap. Handling multi-modal NN requires huge hardware upgrades in the car processors. Sensor suite has to be redesigned too. Tesla is not a serious AI group, because AI takes real science, and real science needs to be flexible. Instead of a hypothesis, vision-only can work, then test it, Elon declared vision-only will work and fires any who dissents.",1/4/2025 21:46,RockyCreamNHotSauce,https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/tesla-fsd-jesse-lyu-train-20014242.php,-0.3754,reddit

All that's required is some sort of shock to burst it but that could happen in the next year or in next 10 years. No one really knows. Consumer confidence is very high right now though and has been for over a decade.

There are signs of an economic shock coming during Trumps presidency if he goes through with what he says he will. Predominantly his Tariffs, the extraction of 20 million illegal immigrants from the American economy and his tax cuts for the rich. These things could be the things that puts a straw on the camels back. But it's impossible to say with certainty.

Many YouTubers and some on X (Troy Teslike) track deliveries over the quarter.that gives us a decent view of how the quarter is going.  I said above earnings wonâ€™t be good. I meant that for the whole year vs last year since deliveries are down. For the quarter they will actually be decent since it was a good W on both cars and energy. 

The real driver is when will Telsa be able to reach a lot higher on deliveries. The new cheap model should help that. Need to calibrate that with sentiment towards Elon and Tesla in North America and Europe - is there a longer term negative trend setting in or will that fade with the election now over.",1/5/2025 23:30,hard_and_seedless,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hrzaw1/up_or_down/,0.7184,reddit

comment,"Important information coming to Tesla, PLEASE READ AND SHARE ASAP !!

How much progress Tesla makes toward making its cars truly self-driving will be critical to how the stock performs this year considering Mr Musk involvement.

Teslaâ€™s progress in achieving fully self-driving cars is a key factor in its stock performance. Tesla has long touted its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features as game-changing technologies that set it apart from competitors. Hereâ€™s why this matters for the stock:

1. Revenue Growth from FSD
	â€¢	Tesla already generates revenue by selling its FSD software as an add-on, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle. If the software achieves true self-driving capability, it could significantly boost adoption rates and recurring revenue (e.g., through subscriptions).
	â€¢	Higher adoption could also make Tesla less reliant on vehicle sales, creating a more software-driven revenue model.

2. Regulatory Approvals 
	â€¢	Achieving full autonomy requires clearing regulatory hurdles, which vary by region. Progress in this area could give Tesla a first-mover advantage in the robotaxi market and autonomous delivery.

3. Competitive Edge in AI and Data
	â€¢	Teslaâ€™s focus on neural networks and its vast dataset (collected from millions of cars) positions it as a leader in the AI race for autonomy. Any breakthroughs in this area could cement Teslaâ€™s position as a tech company rather than just an automaker, potentially justifying its high valuation.

How much progress Tesla makes toward making its cars truly self-driving will be critical to how the stock performs this year considering Mr Musk involvement.

Teslaâ€™s progress in achieving fully self-driving cars is a key factor in its stock performance. Tesla has long touted its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features as game-changing technologies that set it apart from competitors. Hereâ€™s why this matters for the stock:

1. Revenue Growth from FSD
	â€¢	Tesla already generates revenue by selling its FSD software as an add-on, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle. If the software achieves true self-driving capability, it could significantly boost adoption rates and recurring revenue (e.g., through subscriptions).
	â€¢	Higher adoption could also make Tesla less reliant on vehicle sales, creating a more software-driven revenue model.

2. Regulatory Approvals 
	â€¢	Achieving full autonomy requires clearing regulatory hurdles, which vary by region. Progress in this area could give Tesla a first-mover advantage in the robotaxi market and autonomous delivery.

3. Competitive Edge in AI and Data
	â€¢	Teslaâ€™s focus on neural networks and its vast dataset (collected from millions of cars) positions it as a leader in the AI race for autonomy. Any breakthroughs in this area could cement Teslaâ€™s position as a tech company rather than just an automaker, potentially justifying its high valuation.

Tesla going to repeal the 2020 hike:
From $400 + to $2000+ 
In just six months Jan-Aug 2020
Then split 5:1 in August 25, 2020
Just when the pandemic started.

This time Elon Musk in the White House. 
TESLA WILL DO IT AGAINâ€¦. 

Donâ€™t miss out the life time opportunity.

How much progress Tesla makes toward making its cars truly self-driving will be critical to how the stock performs this year considering Mr Musk involvement.

Teslaâ€™s progress in achieving fully self-driving cars is a key factor in its stock performance. Tesla has long touted its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features as game-changing technologies that set it apart from competitors. Hereâ€™s why this matters for the stock:

1. Revenue Growth from FSD
	â€¢	Tesla already generates revenue by selling its FSD software as an add-on, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle. If the software achieves true self-driving capability, it could significantly boost adoption rates and recurring revenue (e.g., through subscriptions).
	â€¢	Higher adoption could also make Tesla less reliant on vehicle sales, creating a more software-driven revenue model.

2. Regulatory Approvals 
	â€¢	Achieving full autonomy requires clearing regulatory hurdles, which vary by region. Progress in this area could give Tesla a first-mover advantage in the robotaxi market and autonomous delivery.

How much progress Tesla makes toward making its cars truly self-driving will be critical to how the stock performs this year considering Mr Musk involvement.

Teslaâ€™s progress in achieving fully self-driving cars is a key factor in its stock performance. Tesla has long touted its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features as game-changing technologies that set it apart from competitors. Hereâ€™s why this matters for the stock:

1. Revenue Growth from FSD
	â€¢	Tesla already generates revenue by selling its FSD software as an add-on, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle. If the software achieves true self-driving capability, it could significantly boost adoption rates and recurring revenue (e.g., through subscriptions).
	â€¢	Higher adoption could also make Tesla less reliant on vehicle sales, creating a more software-driven revenue model.

2. Regulatory Approvals 
	â€¢	Achieving full autonomy requires clearing regulatory hurdles, which vary by region. Progress in this area could give Tesla a first-mover advantage in the robotaxi market and autonomous delivery.

3. Competitive Edge in AI and Data
	â€¢	Teslaâ€™s focus on neural networks and its vast dataset (collected from millions of cars) positions it as a leader in the AI race for autonomy. Any breakthroughs in this area could cement Teslaâ€™s position as a tech company rather than just an automaker, potentially justifying its high valuation.

What new products does Tesla have that are home runs?
1.Good luck with Cyber Cabs doing anything this year. Regulators are going to be difficult to work with. 2.They can offer an EV under $30k, but BYD has them beat on the global market.
3.If their new roadster release and sales perform anything like Cyber Truck, they are in big trouble. You can't deny that TSLA has trouble meeting their own deadlines. 

The Cyber Truck is a failure. It's a doucebag mobile, no offense.

post,"What Tesla should do on earnings January 22nd for massive bull run
When the earnings report release, first thing they should do is say that ""we're excited to announce that our robo-taxi and FSD vehicles are advancing in a fast pace with the help of AI!"" mention that they will be investing heavily into AI and that in the next 5-10 years they will have AI doing most of the jobs for them and laying off a bunch of employees so that increases the company's balance sheet. The next comment they should make is that they're gonna use money from SpaceX and Neuralink to boost the technologies in Tesla and the AI they're working on. Next, get Elon Musk on the call. Elon musk says the word 'AI' 100+ times on the call, and say we still own a lot of BTC; boom we got a $500+ share price right there.

Iâ€™m a bull but earnings might not be great Iâ€™m very surprised we still never broke 500k cars in one quarter. We know the EV tax credit will probably be discontinued, and to the common person they might look at that as a bad thing. Robo taxi is the big hope cause letâ€™s face it a lower cost consumer vehicle is definitely not coming out in 2025. Again Tesla bull here; just like to be super realistic and not get hopes up.

comment,"Here, let me fix this for you:

I'm considering taking an interest-bearing loan from my 401k. I'd have to pay that loan back to my 401k but I'd be buying a stock that is trading at 108x earnings, whose product deliveries are falling, their latest vehicle has been recalled 7 times, and there's no way earnings are going to meet (or beat) analyst expectations due to said reduction in deliveries, prices of recall repairs, and falling vehicle pricing. 

Plus, there is a chance that the stock will tank when the in-coming President ultimately kicks him to the curb like he has done to literally everyone else. 

So, what I would do, is save money so when the stock goes down after earnings, you can start grabbing some up at that time because right now it really is overpriced and Elon is too focused on outerspace and Trump's eyes to care about TSLA.",1/11/2025 13:27,StandardAd239,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hxtlr9/should_i_buy_tesla_on_margin/,0.9178,reddit

he stole tesla from people smarter than him, he stole paypal from people smarter than him. heâ€™s very good at stealing ideas and making it his own. why is a secret super underground network pushing this criminal as if heâ€™s a god among men. heâ€™s a fucking moron and nobody likes him. he wanted to be the worlds richest man when he was a teenager, thatâ€™s how soulless and pathetic this man is. he grew up wanting to be better than other people, he doesnâ€™t want to go to space because he knows the ere is no such thing.Â 

when you go high enough into space, aliens intercept you and tell you to go home or they keep you with them and youâ€™re pronounced dead on earth. thatâ€™s why they stopped making trips outside. because there is no outside. outer space was made in a basement in hollowood.Â 

These are truths. Our world is built on lies. Religious lies science lies itâ€™s all the same. Fuck these shady rich people. Nobody wants the truth they donâ€™t want to see the scary entities that made this place. iâ€™ve seen them, theyâ€™re not that scary but i can tell why weâ€™re all avoiding them, theyâ€™re very uncomfortable to look at.Â 

If majority of people learn how to meditate we donâ€™t need to go space. We could just sit peacefully and become space. But elon wonâ€™t teach humanity that. He probably knows meditation is the universal way to exist, but he doesnâ€™t mention it because it would actually solve a lot of people ans people like elon want more suffering on earth not less problems. you see these crazy entities behind our world theyâ€™re feeding on suffering and greed and stuff like this. evil stuff.Â ",1/14/2025 12:48,LawApprehensive3912,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-musk-as-one-possible-option?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy,-0.9777,reddit

comment,"The problem I have with the FSD tracking is that there isnâ€™t much transparency as far as the testers are concerned. Seemingly anyone can sign up and start reporting critical disengagements. You can go through userâ€™s data one by one but nobody has time for that. If I were a short seller, Iâ€™d definitely have at least a couple of cars reporting large numbers of critical disengagements just to bring the numbers down. The tracker could fix this by doing a histogram or something grouping drivers by number of critical disengagements but I havenâ€™t ever found such a breakdown. 

At the same time, the fact that Tesla doesnâ€™t release these numbers is pretty telling. They could release the data and it would give investors a huge insight into when to expect FSD. Odds are that this data has shown for years that FSD was many years out which is why they havenâ€™t published it. After all, many investors would likely sell and buy back once FSD is closer if they actually knew. 

Either way, Iâ€™m staying long. They are making good progress and I wouldnâ€™t be shocked to see it release in the next few years.",1/14/2025 19:19,sermer48,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i1bmpp/therefore_based_on_this_data_shared_by_musk_tesla/,0.8573,reddit

Sold Tesla on the pop this morning. I know the future is bright for this company, and Iâ€™m rooting for them. The stock is crazy volatile though, and so much speculation has been baked in.

The company is mapping roads with their cameras, recording biometrics from occupants and using AI to parse tons of valuable data. Elon has a great ally in Trump, who will be investing heavily in new infrastructure and charging stations will be a part of that. 

And of course, self driving cars and the robo-taxi model will change everything, eventually.

The less sexy part of all this is car sales. Car sales are unpredictable. Elon is unpredictable (mostly in a good way). Iâ€™m looking for stocks I can hold for 20 years and not worry about, and I donâ€™t think I can stomach the Tesla roller coaster (new product?)

Iâ€™m sure everyone that hangs in there will be handsomely rewarded. For now, I have a piece of TSLA through VOO.

May pop back in if this thing comes back down to earth. Best of luck to all the believers who are supporting this innovative, American company. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Model Y (Juniper) refresh has received a tonne of orders in China. Sales should be next month. Remember this is the best selling vehicle in the world.

Model 2 will be launched soon. We are talking about a much cheaper car & will likely rech their capacity of 3m.

Semi full production by end of year. Factory progressing very well. This will sell like hotcakes. Pepsi love their trucks and can see them buying a lot more. Decent margins too you would expect.

Cybertruck ramp increases further.

Remember on the earnings call Elon stated new vehicles in H1. I do classify the refresh as new. My bet is the Model 2 cheaper model & something else, possibly Roadster is my guess.",1/15/2025 19:31,HAL-_-9001,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i24n4u/sold/,0.9299,reddit

Iâ€™m neutral on the stock, but even if it climbs to $800 a share, how much upside is really left when you weigh the risks?

Cybertruck. I love Elon, but the Cybertruck is a miss I fear. But you know what? It does not matter one bit. Tesla has so many other things going that it just does not matter. 

Model 3 and Y are simply 2 of the best EVs in the world.

Semi - they got this right and have done tons of testing. I have read about nothing but glowing reports from the companies who have done long term tests. Volumes coming this year.

Energy packs- they can sell as many as they make and this is high profit business. Plant in Shanghai coming online that will double output. This can be $1T business.

Right after I made most of my picks, the market took a pretty hard dip. It was really stressful and I felt in over my head. I didnâ€™t really DCA my way in. Lots of bad news on TV, talks of bubbles, war, inflation, etc. etc. I debated handing the whole portfolio over to an advisor. I thought I fucked up. 

I saw though that my ETFs held up pretty well and were still kicking out dividends. It just made me realize I feel less stressed with more diversity.

comment,"Iâ€™m no expert either but what I do know (or at least believe) is that RIGHT NOW Tesla is still very much considered a car company by the masses. We know itâ€™s much more than that and Elon is doing some wild things, but right now itâ€™s seen as a car company who sells cars. So when their car sales do badly we can see that in the stock price (among other factors of course). I reckon in a year, maybe two or three, when all the other projects start to release and pop the stock price will sky rocket because people will see just how much this company really does.

are talking about a brand new, multi-trillion dollar market.  In 5-10 years it might be the largest market on the planet.  ~$400 is pittance compared to what it will be when everyone realizes this.

comment,"What kind of alternate facts universe did I get myself in this sub, where OP says the future is bright for this company?

WTF?

Tesla is going the way of Twitter, an overvalued electric car company led by a president-elect sycophant with no new lines or products coming to market. Being the president-elect elect Chihuahua is not enough to artificially inflate the stock

At some point, sooner than later, when the Elon/Trump divorce happens, the stock will come back down to reality

It is the same with the Trump media company: fake valuation that will hit bottom when he finally leaves or dies",1/16/2025 2:23,MindAccomplished3879,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i24n4u/sold/,-0.807,reddit

post,"Iâ€™ve been holding since 2010. 
I bought a few thousand shares almost 15 years ago now. I sold half of my shares when I ran into some money problems back in 2012ish.

I totally put it out of my head to the point I somehow thought I had sold all of them for years. 

A few years ago I start getting calls from my Edward Jones guy but I ignore them because I thought they just needed an address update. 

Finally I answer and he tells me that my stock is doing extremely well. I was blown away to realize I had any!! And way more than I expected due to the split. 

Iâ€™m still holding strong and wondering if I should pick a number to sell at or if I want to hold for another 10 years. 

It is so so volatile Iâ€™m torn. I would absolutely hate to leave it alone and it disappear. 

But Iâ€™d also hate to take it out and then it eventually go way high. 

I know thereâ€™s no way to accurately predict these things but I have to askâ€¦ 

how high do you see the stock going in 1, 5, 10 years?

The other option of course is that you set a reasonable stop loss? if the stock completely plummets and hits your exit point, you cash out. Bear in mind though as you've mentioned, it's volatile, your stop loss amount can be triggered and you'll exit, when the stock itself might shoot straight back up again.

I think that after the inauguration, I will sell 10 of my shares, enjoy an over 300% return, and let those 5 remaining shares ride.

Trying to get the best of both worlds... if it goes down later on, boo hoo, I will already have over $4000 (I assume) from when it was higher, and if it goes up later on, woohoo, I still have 5 shares.

post,"Elon Musk and the far-reaching consequences of his behaviour...
Interesting fact... I just read an article in a Slovak newspaper about the new exciting Tesla Model Y Juniper starting production in Berlin. And everyone commenting there said they are not going to buy anything from Musk anymore (fascist supporting extremists in Europe etc etc...). Just for the fact, we are a small European country and yet I'm surprised by how many people are disgusted by Musk's behaviour. Now I have no doubts, that his behaviour is absolutely alienating customer base and it's primary reason behind massive decline in sales in Europe. The US most likely will see a big drop this year as well with a $7500 tax incentive most likely dropped. I doubt a new Juniper will change much... That leaves only China. If it weren't for China, the drop in deliveries in 2024 would be so big, that the stock would probably be trading in more car-manufacturer P/E levels (and we shouldn't forget that last year includes ramping up of production for Cybertruck). And now we are entering Trump era. He will most likely start a trade war with China. Tesla's biggest market being what? Of course China. Now I know many people will say that the Gigafactory is in China in Shanghai and won't be affected by tarrifs as such. But we all know that China has no problem going against big corporations (e.g. Alibaba). Just to punish the US for tarrifs and Tik Tok ban and their attempt to kill everything Chinese in the US? Musk being the biggest ally of Trump, he can easily be targeted by the Chinese government. I don't have a good feeling about all this. Trump falling out with Musk is another thing. And don't forget it takes fully functional software and hardware for Tesla to truly deliver and justify the valuation of T$LA. Knowing Musk, he will push for unsupervised FSD at the end of this year to avoid another blow to investors' hopes. And it will only takes one major failure of the software, even if only one in 10,000 miles to halt the progress they're making. Even if they don't get a scrutiny from regulators as before, the public opinion matters. Their reputation because of Musk's behaviour and some media-outlets going all out to publish every possible news-worthy articles to dictedit Tesla can hurt the brand and their ambitions so much, that it can completely halt the progress they're making. Musk's behaviour coupled with many haters out there is a recipe for disaster, if you ask me... I don't see FSD software adoption coupled with profit from robotaxis to be as high as Musk claim it could possibly be. There's still Waymo (if people perceive Waymo as the totally safe fully autonomous vehicle they will still pay for it, even if it will cost more than Cybercab), then there's Zoox that will launch soon and can take 4 people at once and all Chinese companies that already have robotaxi services in China, meaning the competition can be pretty big overseas... All I'm trying to say is that there are so many things that can go wrong this year. And the valuation of T$LA is so big, that there's no room for an error.",1/17/2025 6:05,elysium_pictures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i39yn3/elon_musk_and_the_farreaching_consequences_of_his/,-0.9864,reddit

comment,"Every customer group matters. I read somewhere that in Europe there was 40% decline or something like that in sales compared to 2023. The image of the brand was damaged without any doubt. Same in the US. Relying on China is never good. The government there can interfere with a blink of an eye and disrupt the deliveries easily. Alibaba has faced regulatory scrutiny and a crackdown by the Chinese government, which has led to the company restructuring and fines. Now Tesla is the US company, so they probably wouldn't be affected as bad, but now with the US Tik Tok ban and upcoming tariffs (most likely), China can start targeting the US companies in a similar way. Can say for example that Tesla vehicles are spying on Chinese and restrict their sales on Chinese soil. Probably not going to happen this way, I'm just giving an example that relying on one market is very dangerous.",1/17/2025 11:39,elysium_pictures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i39yn3/elon_musk_and_the_farreaching_consequences_of_his/,-0.9084,reddit

The ONLY question is how much damage has been done.

Or let me put it another way.

With Optimus having the most advanced humanoid hand in the world which also received the FDA approval for linking with neuralink to help people who lost their hand. They have a feedback loop to close the gap between human and robotic hand sensing and dexterity. 

With FSD almost solved, Tesla's tech along with robotaxis will form the foundation and backbone of new economies. Imagine being able to order food and groceries from restaurants at 10X lower cost compared to what you get charged from DoorDash or Uber now. The other companies will take a decade to catch up, they will need to leverage the advancements in AI that will reduce the amount of training data required to match what their systems can collect.

With battery storage systems becoming increasingly important in high frequency control for power delivery for data centers that train large models and also to minimize the cost of energy by reducing the peak energy required from conventional power sources, it is inevitable that Tesla will play a huge role in the grid stabilization and power supply to the US and other countries around the world. Their systems are consistently ranked the best.

Tesla is the only company that can compete with China in manufacturing. Xi Jinping's highest priority currently is to mass produce humanoid robots and deliver results similar to their advancements in EV industries.

All these advancements will compound with each other and with other companies that Elon runs, for example [X.ai](http://X.ai) break throughs with Grok will provide the voice interface to communicate with the robotaxi and optimus robots. The x.ai's new investment in the gaming industry will provide the simulation tech needed to collect massive amount of training data (for free) needed to train Optimus with new capabilities. Another example is driving the costs of building cars and robots by leveraging Optimus or the unboxed manufacturing process, these are some of the advantages of vertical integration.

Markets and analysts are not people who are well versed with Technology. They follow **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**, this economic theory suggests that at any given time, asset prices fully reflect all available information. Since most people don't know technology deep enough they just wait for the new revenues to show up to price the stock. This gives people who are working on cutting edge and break through technologies huge advantage in the current market. You can look up how many people in the deep learning field including Geoffrey Hinton had the conviction to invest in Nvidia before it sky rocketed.

comment,"The automotive industry is not winner take all and it never has been. Investing in a â€œcompetitorâ€ is not necessarily betting against Tesla. 

Rivian is a perfect example. I donâ€™t consider them a direct competitor to Tesla since neither offers a vehicle in the same segment (yet). However, the R2 will likely â€œcompeteâ€ with the Model Y. But the market is certainly large enough for both models to get plenty of sales. In fact, thereâ€™s plenty of people that would never consider buying a Model Y yet will fall in love with and purchase the R2 (and vice versa). 

Lucid is another good example. Arguably the Lucid Air competes with the Model S, but I doubt thereâ€™s as much cross-shopping those models as you might think. Lucid Air is getting cross-shopped with foreign luxury brands far more than Tesla. The markets certainly overlap, but weâ€™re dealing with ven diagrams here, not a single circle.

All of that said, besides Lucid and Rivian, Iâ€™m not seeing many other options yet. 

My bias: Iâ€™m invested in both Tesla and Rivian, but not Lucid as I think their financials have issues. I follow the automotive industry closely but not professionally.",1/17/2025 22:11,Somnisixsmith,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i3qb09/if_youre_gonna_invest_in_an_electric_car_company/,0.896,reddit

comment,"**Reason for stock volatility:**

Focus on the long term, dollar cost average into the stock and forget about it. I expect the stock to go 10X in the next 10 years. The expected CAGR is about 26% for the stock to 10X in 10 years.

Given the rate of advancement in AI and the breakthroughs we see in robotic control and manipulation, it is guaranteed that we can build a humanoid robot that can do tasks at home like loading dishwasher and folding clothes. With Optimus having the most advanced humanoid hand in the world which also received the FDA approval for linking with neuralink to help people who lost their hand. They have a feedback loop to close the gap between human and robotic hand sensing and dexterity.

With FSD almost solved, Tesla's tech along with robotaxis will form the foundation and backbone of new economies. Imagine being able to order food and groceries from restaurants at 10X lower cost compared to what you get charged from DoorDash or Uber now. The other companies will take a decade to catch up, they will need to leverage the advancements in AI that will reduce the amount of training data required to match what their systems can collect.

With battery storage systems becoming increasingly important in high frequency control for power delivery for data centers that train large models and also to minimize the cost of energy by reducing the peak energy required from conventional power sources, it is inevitable that Tesla will play a huge role in the grid stabilization and power supply to the US and other countries around the world. Their systems are consistently ranked the best.

Tesla is the only company that can compete with China in manufacturing. Xi Jinping's highest priority currently is to mass produce humanoid robots and deliver results similar to their advancements in EV industries.

All these advancements will compound with each other and with other companies that Elon runs, for exampleÂ X.aiÂ break throughs with Grok will provide the voice interface to communicate with the robotaxi and optimus robots. The x.ai's new investment in the gaming industry will provide the simulation tech needed to collect massive amount of training data (for free) needed to train Optimus with new capabilities. Another example is driving the costs of building cars and robots by leveraging Optimus or the unboxed manufacturing process, these are some of the advantages of vertical integration.

Markets and analysts are not people who are well versed with Technology. They followÂ Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), this economic theory suggests that at any given time, asset prices fully reflect all available information. Since most people don't know technology deep enough they just wait for the new revenues to show up to price the stock. This gives people who are working on cutting edge and break through technologies huge advantage in the current market. You can look up how many people in the deep learning field including Geoffrey Hinton had the conviction to invest in Nvidia before it sky rocketed.

EMHÂ is also the reason many innovative companies are underpriced. So the stock price of these companies follow the revenue streams and the growth they actually delivered. Which is an opportunity for people work in the breakthrough field and have this information advantage.

In summary, if you want your stock to grow 10X or more, then don't sell.",1/17/2025 22:28,Terrible_Basis3357,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i39yn3/elon_musk_and_the_farreaching_consequences_of_his/,0.993,reddit

comment,"Teslaâ€™s competition ends once tesla makes cheap electric vehicles like what musk envisioned before. 

As it is right now, theyâ€™re looking more like status symbols especially the cybertruck, instead of the average persons EV. 

Thatâ€™s the only way tesla will make big money. Make their stuff cheaper, make it mass produced, make it easier for the average person to access. 

Look at how their sales fell in europe especially in the netherlands in the past few years. Itâ€™s mostly due to competition providing cheaper EVs.

Most people buy EV to save on gas so most people canâ€™t afford premium vehicles in the first place as well as to â€œsave the environmentâ€, so this whole showing off expensive vehicles thing again has a target audience, but they wonâ€™t be sold as much as a cheaper mass produced EV. 

I understand having a luxury lineup for something like roadster or plaid s, but that shouldnâ€™t be their focus.

comment,"Highly unlikely that competition ends. Any market that is hugely important for an economy or nation will have lots of competition. The only question is, how long will it take for the competition to arrive?

The innovator will need to continue to innovate and add more value to keep their market share. There are few exceptions to this where network effects play a huge role, for example in social networks, once the innovator captures the market and builds the network, it makes it increasingly difficult for other players with equally good solution to break into the market because of network effects.

I suspect Teslaâ€™s Robotaxis donâ€™t have the network effect advantage but they only have the innovation advantage.

comment,"Except that someone showing a middle finger while saying ""I hope your investments go up!"" would obviously not be really wishing you well, but rather being sarcastic. The gesture of showing the middle and making a statement (supposedly) wishing someone good are obviously incompatible, which can only be understood as sarcasm and mean spirited.

Meanwhile, Elon's gesture of putting his hand on his chest and extending his arm so as to symbolize giving his heart to the spectators is actually accompanied by the statement ""my heart goes out to you"", which sounded like a genuine expression of enthusiasm and excitement.

Believe me, if there is someone who would be alert about literal Nazis, that would be me. I am a Hispanic mulatto with Sephardic Jewish ancestry. I am no fanatic and I am politically homeless because I make an effort to look at the nuances of any policy. I am also highly disturbed by how the media is already distorting what happened.

But I am even more disturbed by the fact that the media barely has to do a anything anything; people are already conditioned and ready to see what they want to see in order to convince themselves that they are right and that others are the devil.",1/21/2025 0:20,TutuSanto,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i5yisl/is_it_going_to_be_a_red_day_tomorrow/,0.8929,reddit

comment,"I would rather see direct investment in the companies in some manner. We cannot just drop EV support. But the tax credit had been around for 15 years. It was originally supposed to drop off after X number of vehicles were made. But Tesla passed this level very quickly. 

The thing is, does the tax credit really serve its purpose? The average price of an EV is $55k. For those who can afford that, is $7500 really the difference between buying the car and not? You need to be pretty rich to afford a $55k vehicle. Seems better if the government took all of that money and helped create cheaper batteries. The CCP subsidizes the development. That is different than giving money back to the buyer. You want to aell a lot of EVs ?

My favorite, did you know that the model S from 2016 through 2019 is listed as having a hit swapable battery? So that it qualified for nearly 3x the amount of regulatory credits.

comment,"Let's see...

Their cars are old and stale. Elon didn't even bother announcing the M3 refresh they launched in China. He basically doesn't give a shit about selling cars any more and has admitted as much.

Their vision-only FSD doesn't work properly and is incredibly unsafe and dangerous. It's architecturally a bad product. More data is not going to fix it.

Their Robotaxis will not work properly because their FSD system is like I said, complete garbage. It will cause hundreds of accidents per month, many fatal. The Trump government will be OK with this though. However they are light years behind Waymo. I expect cities to ban Tesla robotaxis shortly after launch because of the accidents they will cause.

If Trump begins playing with tariffs, expect Tesla to be a retaliatory target.

Optimus is an immensely stupid product.

CyberTruck is a piece of shit and will probably not survive the year. Unsellable most everywhere except the USA.

Everyone in the EU hates Elon now and his Tesla sales on the continent will not be pretty in 2025. Expect the German factory to see layoffs and reduced production.

The stock is immensely overvalued and pumped by Elon sycophants and his proximity to Trump.

In the EU no one gives a crap about supercharger networks. We have chargers everywhere, and they are not from Tesla.

The only thing they have going for them is Tesla battery parks, which I guess is still selling.

Make of this what you want. The stock will probably go up in the short term because of Elon sycophants on X and the Trump admin will be pumping it, but will tank soon enough when new sales (or lack of) numbers come out.

China might limit the damage if the M3 refresh is successful but I have my doubts.",1/21/2025 14:21,SpaceKappa42,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i5yisl/is_it_going_to_be_a_red_day_tomorrow/,-0.9043,reddit

I can also do a percentage of each, but I kinda wanna do 100% of one of the choices.  
TSLA options could pay off handsomely if the price shoots up, though they could also expire worthless if the stock tanks. I have 10 years from today to exercise the option, however if I leave the company then I have 3 months from termination to exercise the option.

post,"Elon Musk is not a Nazi
(Bullish post because the stock went down today due to trading algorithms sensing a bunch of negative news surrounding Elon and it's stupid and temporary)

He didn't do the nazi salute. Why? Because he said that's not what he intended to do. You can speculate all day about it but at the end of the day a real nazi from the 1940s would be proudly throwing up a Hitler salute, saying how much they love Hitler, saying that yes they absolutely did intend to do a nazi salute, and then probably tell you how much they hate jews.

The media implying that these 2 things are the same is ridiculous. Believing that Elon Musk is a nazi without hearing him out is ridiculous. We need to bring back giving people reasonable benefit of the doubt. A nazi is not someone who puts their arm in the air for any reason. A nazi is a fascist, genocidal maniac who goes and actively tries to exterminate all Jewish people.

Elon Musk is not a nazi. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And if someone tells me they didn't intend something they did a certain way I will generally beleive them because that's basic human decency.

And especially because Elon is openly very pro Israel. If he were a nazi don't you think he would be supporting Palestine and/or hamas? There are a lot of people who openly support Palestine over Israel so it's not like it's an incredibly unpopular stance to take. This is why the ADL supports Elon and does not think he is a Nazi:

Looks like the reason why numbers in China were so good towards the end of the last year was because people were rushing to buy before the end of EV incentives. I wouldn't be surprised to see Tesla sell & deliver around the same number of cars as in 2024, if they come up with new models and ramp up Juniper and that's not good at all...

My account was up 243% last year and largely due to TSLA (TSLL)... some other plays too. But TESLA is my highest conviction play, let me share.

In my mind itâ€™s financially irresponsible to not own at least some TSLA. The opportunity cost is too much to play the other side. Tesla is going to the biggest company in the world In my opinion, between FSD, energy storage, robo taxis, they are in the middle of multiple S curves which all project to be worth much more than the current valuation. TESLA is not just a car company, we all believe that otherwise we wouldn't be here. People don't realize that the energy sector of Tesla is growing at an unprecedented rate.

*Why TSLA (skip this and go to the trading info if you don't wanna read)*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FSD: if you never been in a fsd Tesla, find a way to get in the seat of one. Self driving is here, robotaxis already exists with WAYMO. So the stage is set. The market is already proven. Tesla imo is the leader of the front on that. With them being able to license it out, have their own fleet of robotaxis, the chargers. All of that will pay massive margins.

Optimus: the human robot, maybe farther away then the robotaxis, but still within reach, I believe we are in the AI revolution, just like the insurstiral revolution , the tech boom, this will be the next thing. AI is here. Energy storage: with ai and all these need for data centers. Americaâ€™s energy infrastructure is far from adequate to handle this kind of new demand. I donâ€™t believe they will be the leader of that sector, but the margins on their batteries is enough to add to the bottom line thatâ€™s for sure Elon musk is now in the white house for all intents and purposes. I bet on the man well before that. Name a time when it was smart to bet against him.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how I allow Tesla's volatility make me money: I WHEEL TSLA: First off, I wheel TSLL instead of TSLA because of the added leverage = more premiums. Tsla obviously less volatile, more capital intensive. Pretty much the market is saying â€œoh your opinion on tsla didnâ€™t change since last week, still think itâ€™ll be above 35.70 (TSLL) at some point, hereâ€™s 200$ for not changing your opinionâ€. My goal is to use the premiums to acquire shares.

I don't know if it will take 1 year or 3 years or 5 years for tesla to get cyber cabs, so I make money owning shares and selling covered calls. You may ask, why cap the upside if your bullish on TESLA? I have long term shares in another account, but I am capitalizing on the volatility that Elon gives us (it's a gift). Tesla won't always go up (in the short term), so I want to make money on the downside, and get PAID to own tesla for cheaper- i am always looking to buy shares.

I also plan to start accumulating more of actual $TSLA next year and slide off off the leveraged ETFs. It was a great year for them. Need to get off them before the gains decay away. There's more detail to this strategy if you have any questions I'd be happy to respond.

Let me know your thoughts and if this seems like a reasonable way to capitalize on TESLA and it's volatility!",1/22/2025 14:36,PG-Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i7chqo/thanks_tsla_and_elon_for_15k/,0.9969,reddit

Dropped off my XP at the Tesla dealer for service today and was chatting with the main manager who has been there since it opened. He said he expects Model Y Juniper to release next week. Timed to blunt a bad earnings call on 1/29? We'll see.

If so, it will be interseting to see if there's a boom of new orders and if the stock pops.

post,"Tesla to significantly raise prices of all cars in Canada, website shows
Jan 22 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab will raise prices of all its cars in Canada from Feb. 1, according to notices on its Canadian website, with prices of Model 3 going up by as much as C$9,000 ($6,254.78).

Model Y variants will see increases of up to C$4,000, while all versions of Model S and X will rise by C$4,000, according to the website.

Tesla did not provide a reason for the price increase.

The company does not produce cars in Canada and imports from other factories. It was not immediately clear how many cars Tesla exports to Canada from its Shanghai, China factory and its plants in the United States.

The company did not respond to Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours.

The unexpected move by Tesla to raise prices comes as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated on Tuesday that his government was ready to respond if U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb 1.
Canada already imposes a 100% tariff on imports of electric vehicles from China, including Tesla cars manufactured in Shanghai.",1/23/2025 4:56,tnguyen5057,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-raise-prices-all-cars-canada-feb-1-website-shows-2025-01-23/,0.5742,reddit

comment,"There is so much disdain and bearish sentiment that it is bound to go up. 

Look at all the shills replying to your question calling Tesla overvalued as if that hasn't been known for years. 

There is concern about the EV mandate being repealed but who the fuck actually bought a tesla because they had to??? 

And even with EV rebates/credits being removed, Tesla's competitive edge will only widen especially with tariffs on the way to dissuade international competition in the US.   
  
Personally, I think it will be an earnings beat but the stock may stagnate regardless.

comment,"Just going to float this: regardless of what happens in the near future , Tesla will be screwed as long as Elon is in the picture. 

A slightly different angle. Talented Engineers, logistics specialists, accounting, marketing, etcâ€¦ will either be leaving or commanding significant pay increases. New talent will demand huge pay packages because no one wants to constantly explain to their friends and family about how/why they work for a Nazi. A percentage wont consider it no matter the pay. 

Iâ€™ve seen this up close with Phillip Morris. Any position above associate manager commands a premium. Top talent often wonâ€™t even entertain working for them even when the same position pays double. PM does their best to keep their head down, Elon however seems to need the attention. Between his antics and his public treatment of X employees, youâ€™d seriously have to evaluate whether working for him is a smart career path. 

This is even more problematic for a company like Tesla which needs to innovate constantly and canâ€™t afford to let competitors catch up (though many are close if not ahead in several areas). The results wonâ€™t be felt for a few years but the impact will be huge if not corrected quickly.

Bitcoin - They have around $1B they can realise, which would feed through to the bottom line.

What will be important is guidance. How is the new Model 2/Q going & is it still on target for H1.

comment,"Given that it seems the consensus on Reddit is that thisâ€™ll fall, I reckon itâ€™ll go up. Â 

I donâ€™t really think the stock price is all that much attached to the current financials though. Thereâ€™s a lot of Elon Musk being valued into it, as well as the future potential with things like Optimus etc (itâ€™s ambitious but if they can successfully execute on this Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by a long shot). I personally wouldnâ€™t bet on short term price moves, but longer term I do think thisâ€™ll be much higher and so I continue to hold without concern. Musk clearly isnâ€™t worried about the future as heâ€™s happily triggering a large number of Teslaâ€™s customers Â ",1/29/2025 1:45,Valuable_Economist14,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ichqb6/thoughts_on_tomorrow_results/,0.9418,reddit

comment,"I think the earnings might be good even though they sold less cars than projected.
But people need to think ahead, future groeth and potential.
Do many new projects, new model, new market facilities (india), FSD, optimus, cutting manufacturing costs, yes new model more expensive but you get more accessories for less price of them.

People are so softminded, look at the DeepSeek with AI, they lost their minds and crashed Nvidia stock in fear! 
They dont realize that even that news is huge and good for Nvidia, google ""jevons paradox"" and learn something proven!

So many new NVDA-investors and DCA thanks to those who dumbly sold of.

DeepStick/DeepSh*T/DipStick or w/e not even provided any proof of their claims regarding hardware, project time nor real budget than claimed max 5-6M$.

Of course, itâ€™s 1.5B short of expectations on revenue, but as long as profits are increasing (considering the context of less sales because the new Model Y was released in 2025) does that really matter?

Profits matter more than anything, and a 3% increase despite a 1% decrease in overall deliveries is huge, just proving once again Tesla is focused on optimization.

post,"Target buy in post earnings Q4
Iâ€™m excited by the endless possibilities and pending developments with TESLA on the AI and Robotics side of things. I think we are starting to see it morph into a AI and Robotics company and less of an auto company. What we are seeing now is that transitional phase in the market were some investors perceive it strictly as an auto company thus the numbers in q4 were not encouraging. In the long run this will stabilize TSLa as a stock and commence the upward trend when it fully transitions to an AI and Robotics company that happens to sell electric vehicles as well..

I have a bridge to sell you. If is not something that's 6-12 months away. If means there's a good chance it'll never be able to do what's claimed. If there was any proof it could currently be useful, companies would be pre-ordering it like crazy.Â 


What I can tell you that if computer vision training becomes cheap enough to train robots, Tesla will find 100x more competitors in that space than in electric cars.

post,"Is TSLA headed for a gamma squeeze ?
if bullish sentiment and options activity align then YES ! 

# How a Gamma Squeeze Can Happen in Tesla ($TSLA)

1. **High Open Interest in Out-of-the-Money (OTM) Call Options**
2. If a large number of traders buy **OTM call options** on Tesla, market makers who sell these options must hedge their risk by buying Tesla shares.
3. **Stock Price Moves Up**
4. If Teslaâ€™s stock price rises, some of these **OTM calls move closer to in-the-money (ITM)**, increasing the delta (the sensitivity of an option's price to the stockâ€™s price movement).
5. **Market Makers Adjust Their Hedge (Buy More Shares)**
6. As delta increases, market makers need to buy more Tesla stock to stay delta-neutral, which pushes the stock price even higher.
7. **Self-Fulfilling Feedback Loop**
8. As the stock price increases, more OTM calls become ITM, requiring more hedging (more share purchases), leading to a rapid price surgeâ€”a classic gamma squeeze.

# Factors That Can Trigger a Tesla Gamma Squeeze

* **Massive Call Buying**: Retail and institutional traders buying Tesla call options with high open interest.
* **Low Liquidity or High Short Interest**: If there's limited supply, rapid buying can cause a short squeeze alongside a gamma squeeze.
* **Positive Catalysts**: Earnings beats, strong delivery numbers, or major news (like an AI breakthrough, new model release, or Elon Musk's announcements) can trigger initial upward momentum.
* **Weekly Options Expiry (OpEx) Events**: Many traders use short-term options, which can accelerate a gamma squeeze when expiration approaches.",1/31/2025 16:07,Distinct-Check-2893,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iei7bs/is_tsla_headed_for_a_gamma_squeeze/,0.9324,reddit

comment,"Itâ€™s pretty easy as American Tesla is made in America so import tax force them to import from Europe factory as China factory banned. Europe meantime can start making up environmental laws explicitly related to Tesla German factory site to hammer it thus forcing lower production from the German site. Dont be mistaken. Childish games can be had by both sides. 

Trump is starting a fight with clear consequences for both sides in what will be a war of attrition with no long term benefit to either but clear benefit to China with their lower 10% tariff over Canadas 25%.",2/1/2025 13:04,John_mcgee2,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/politics/2025/01/31/chrystia-freeland-says-canada-should-target-elon-musks-tesla-in-a-tariff-fight/,0.7183,reddit

comment,"Teslaâ€™s supply chain is significantly intertwined with Canada, Mexico, and China, making the company susceptible to recent tariff changes.

Dependence on Mexico:
	â€¢	Component Sourcing: Approximately 15% of the components used in Teslaâ€™s Model Y vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported from Mexico.  ï¿¼

Dependence on Canada:
	â€¢	Component Sourcing: Tesla imports certain components from Canada, though specific percentages are not publicly disclosed.

Dependence on China:
	â€¢	Battery Materials: Tesla relies on China for critical battery materials, such as graphite. The company has previously advocated for lower tariffs on China-made electric vehicles in Canada, indicating a reliance on Chinese manufacturing.  ï¿¼

Given these dependencies, recent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trumpâ€”25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese goodsâ€”could significantly impact Teslaâ€™s production costs and supply chain operations.  ï¿¼",2/2/2025 20:30,Flat-Trouble-7777,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/politics/2025/01/31/chrystia-freeland-says-canada-should-target-elon-musks-tesla-in-a-tariff-fight/,-0.4019,reddit

comment,"Bear case:
1) With no EPA, no MPG targets...no need to buy carbon credits, so this revenue is going away.
2) Punitive retaliatory tariffs could reasonably be targeted at Trump's key advisors business with minimal impact to the importing country. Washing away Tesla international sales. Although probably not in China.
3) AI can always be knocked off, see DeepSeek as example. Just because a computer is indefinitely more useful than a pad of paper and pencil, doesn't mean the computer wasn't commoditised, prices will not appreciate for long.
4) There is more money for Elon to get wins from Trump for SpaceX vs Tesla 

Bull case:
1) AI will continue to be huge, and transportation and manual labor will be the killer apps. They will have and maintain huge motes, and competition will be minimal because the kind of AI they are developing is hard to replicate.
2) Elon's close relationship with Trump will guarantee gains for all of his enterprises.

Same with the EU because of Giga Berlin. The EU does not import Teslas from countries outside the EU. They would be tariffing themselves, so also not gonna happen/not going to do anything...?

And Canada actually gets Teslas from the US but sometimes Tesla switches to importing all Teslas to Canada from China instead (they go back and forth about every 6 months these days).

As for the EU, true, but same situation. Giga Berlin brought a lot of economic prosperity to the region.

comment,"They get sued by Musk. We'll see what happens. 
This is already happening: Musk imports his Teslas produced in China to EU. And he's suing EC ,( European commission) because if the tarrifs. 

In June 2024, the EU imposed tariffs on EVs manufactured in China, citing concerns over unfair state subsidies that could distort market competition. The tariffs range from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for other Chinese automakers.

The decision followed an investigation that concluded Chinese EV manufacturers benefited from state support, such as low-interest loans and subsidised land, enabling them to sell vehicles at lower prices in Europe.

Tesla's lawsuit concerns new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, arguing they disrupt competition and advancement in the European EV market.

post,"How do you come to a valuation for FSD?
Iâ€™m having a hard time understanding how FSD will drive Teslaâ€™s market cap up into the multiple trillions.  I appreciate the scope of the project and the advancements in general AI, but besides capturing some of the ride-share market and maybe replacing truckers, how much revenue can this thing actually generate?   At current valuation isnâ€™t this priced in? 


Iâ€™m not going to buy FSD and thereâ€™s no way in hell
Iâ€™d lend out my Tesla when Iâ€™m not using it.  Who actually needs it beyond a certain niche?

comment,"Step 1: launch robotaxi fleet small scale (few thousand per city) and replace waymo by pricing on par with Uber (like half of waymo's pricing) and having geofenced areas until the service is ready

Step 2: launch large scale robotaxi fleet across the nation (~20k - ~50k robotaxis) no geofencing, at half the price of Uber, completely taking over the taxi market from Taxis, Ubers, and Lyfts

Step 3: Fully ramped robotaxi fleet across the nation. >100k robotaxis. Due to scale the price per mile for robotaxis is like 1/4 what Uber's pricing was. This begins to compete with public transport in general (buses and trains) because there is always a robotaxi a few minutes away, the pricing is only a little more expensive than public transport, and it can take you directly from your home directly to your destination.

Step 4: continued cost cutting, improvements in safety, and ease of accessibility mean that many people become comfortable using robotaxi services instead of ever even owning a car. This technology has the potential to disrupt the car market itself. Anyone who can't afford a car no longer needs to buy their own, and anyone who does buy their own will likely rent it out as a robotaxi to make money when they're not using it.

That is how you reach multiple trillions of dollars from just robotaxis. Disruption of multiple large industries simultaneously",2/4/2025 0:45,Vibraniumguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ih4tif/how_do_you_come_to_a_valuation_for_fsd/,0.8225,reddit

comment,"If ten percent of all passenger cars sold in the US (even non teslas assuming Tesla licenses it out) each year eventually subscribe to FSD, the first year would yield $1.5B assuming $100 per month subscription fee. After ten years, this increases to $15B per year assuming ten percent of all new passenger cars continue to use FSD.

Letâ€™s imagine a scenario where FSD becomes so advanced that insurance companies give discounts for drivers who use it, and adoption rate increases to 50 percent of every passenger car sold in the US. This would result in $7.5B of new revenue per year using the same $100 per month per car assumption. At a constant adoption rate, after 10 years this can be $75B of additional revenue per year. 

Now if we extrapolate that to a scenario where 50 percent of all cars purchased in the world (not just the US) then this can hypothetically bring in 2 trillion or so in additional annual revenue.  And this doesnâ€™t account for the leveraged benefits of FSD/machine learning in Optimus bot applications.

IMO this is highly unlikely to materialize in over the next 20 years. But i do think we will reach a point where other automakers will look to adopt teslas FSD capabilities, just like theyâ€™re trying to adopt the supercharger network.",2/4/2025 4:04,Crazy_Day5359,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ih4tif/how_do_you_come_to_a_valuation_for_fsd/,0.8445,reddit

comment,"Nowhere in here do you have a valuation. This is just the order in which you think robotaxi will takeover the market share from different businesses. 

Uber and lyft get a few billion in net income per year. Their revenue is around 40 billion, so if robotaxis scale to 1/4 the cost per mile they'll generate 10 billion in revenue per year. Then there are still costs associated, whether you're paying the owner of the car or if tesla owns the car itself. It's also really naive to think there won't be viable competition if there's money to be made. 

People are still going to own their own cars. Years ago people were saying uber was going to make it so people didn't need their own anymore, and same shit is happening now. But people like having their own car, they like leaving when they want and not waiting even a few minutes through an app, being able to keep their own shit in it, etc etc.

comment,"That is the question. I would say yes they absolutely can IF the price gets low enough. Because even if it's like $0.2/mile for public transit, if Tesla hits $0.5/mile imo that's enough to compete because you can go directly from your house to your destination with a robotaxi but can't with a train or bus. At some point people will pay a slight premium for the uber-like experience. And for reference uber is around $2/mile iirc.

2 people per car is fine. If you have more people just request a second cybercab or maybe pay extra for an autonomous model Y or something. As for the roads I don't think they'd be jammed, because most people using robotaxis would be people who normally use cars (like how most people who use Ubers do have cars). They can't use their car and a robotaxi at the same time. Plus the robotaxis will be able to communicate with each other and drive routes/speeds such that they reduce traffic as much as possible. So realistically the more robotaxis on the road at any one time the less traffic there will be because human drivers driving less predictably will be the largest cause of traffic jams.

A couple hundred billion for disrupting Uber/taxis, another couple hundred billion for disrupting all of public transit, and if they start disrupting car sales themselves then that would be where the multiple trillions come in. And don't forget, this is world wide, not specifically just the United States. Tesla is going to try to launch robotaxis everywhere. So I would say several trillion for disrupting the global car market even just like 10%.

Additionally, if FSD is a success that bodes extremely well for Optimus, which is what could potentially take the company to over $30 trillion. Why? Because 1) disrupting all human labor will dramatically increase the size of the global economy like how the internet and computers drastically increased the size of the global economy, and 2) I'm not even talking about most the human labor. If tesla only takes 10% of the global humanoid robot market (or all of human labor) that'll be something like 10% of a $300 trillion market.

post,"The future of Robotaxis
We already have Robotaxis in a few cities (Waymo). These are highly trained cars limited to a small, heavily trained area. They are statistically  safer than a human driver. Unfortunately, the cost of training and equipment is very high so no way to make a profit (hence GM shutting down their Cruise program). 

Tesla has a different approach. They are using AI and training for every road and scenario. Luckily they have millions of drivers to gather data (and training feedback) for the AI stack. This is a much longer process but in the end will cost a fraction and will work in most areas without much 'refinement training.'

So now Tesla is doing the refinement training for the Austin area and will launch there first. They already have cars leaving the factory and solo driving to a parking lot. They go down a difficult road with various obstacles, etc to park themselves. Of course, the AI stack has a lot of refinement training for this area. 

In fact, Tesla Robotaxis are already in the Austin area. Tesla employees (the brave ones : ) have been using them for a while. 

So Robotaxis are a matter of not if, but when. And they will be safer than a human driver (not that difficult of a bar to beat). And they will cost a fraction of Uber. It will be huge. 

In the short term, they will launch city by city. They will eat away at Uber rides. Then people will realize they can get home piss drunk and will go out drinking more. Some people will trust them enough to send their kids to soccer, etc. 

Yes, it will take some time before the general public will whole heartily embrace a driverless taxi. But the low cost and convenience will win them over sooner or later. Deep down, most people are cheap asses and lazy. 

Value of this? How much is Uber worth? 140 billion. But Robotaxis will be WAY more profitable as no driver cost. And Tesla already has a large fleet of cars that can be converted to Robotaxis. 

Once this takes hold in mainstream society, people will stop buying a second or third car. Non-Tesla car sales will drop substantially. The industry can't handle a drop in sales as fixed costs are too high - so the weak ones will go out of business. 

And just like me with Facebook, you will be almost forced to use a Robotaxi. I was a very early Facebook user but realized it was a waste of time. But I was forced into using it as all family, friend and event information as disseminated on FB. If I didn't use FB, I lost out on being connected to people. 

Remember the part about people being lazy? Well, same thing here. People couldn't bother texting event info. They could just post once on FB and forget about it. 

So one day - one year or ten - into the future, you will be riding in a Robotaxi. 

In the meantime, the news will plaster any crash or malfunction on a Robotaxi as the news is about eyes, not news. A human powered taxi crashing is not big news. 

For people who like to party at venues, imagine a day when you can have a few drinks at home, call a Robotaxi and be safely brought to a bar, sporting event, etc. for a few $$  - and then you can continue to drink as much as you can handle. When you are struggling to walk, you book a Robo home - no worries. For females, no worry an Uber driver to take advantage of your drunkenness. 

Another result will be far fewer drunk drivers on the road. DDs account for 1/3 of accident fatalities. We will see much safer roads that align with the number or Robotaxis or FSD trips. Now the media will have something positive to report on. 

And once this takes hold, insurance rates will change dramtically. Insurance companies are based on statistics (actuary science). They know better than anyone else. People who drive themselves will pay more for insurance. And one day further into the future it will be difficult to - or maybe even illegal - to drive yourself. 

So buy TSLA now so you will have enough money for unlimited Robotaxi rides : )

  
Oh, this same thing will apply to Optimus. It will take longer as there is not much training data but the impact will be 10X Robotaxis. 

Go back to when the Internet started. It was not a big deal. 99% of people didn't use it. The ones that did saw the potential. Look at whenn Google started - looked lame but soon killed all other search (we forget what we used before Google). 

Same with the iPhone. I was one of the first iPhone users. I worked with vairous Samsung entities (including cell phones as they were called back then) and brought my iPhone to show it to execs and staff. Execs said ""Too expensive, no one will buy it."" Meanwhile, the female staff level employees were enthralled with just the photo handling alone. Sometime later, Samsung asked me for help with their new smartphone (Bada OS). Funny. But I was semi-retired, having kids and not living in Korea anymore. And I knew they couldn't produce an OS to save their lives. So I gave that a pass : )

Yes, this is one of those moments in history where life will take a monumental shift.

The silly thing is the competing companies are much better at Uber, than Uber. Grab in SE Asia is way better than Uber. Uber app sucks in comparison. Uber owns 1/4 of Grab. 

Robotaxis will harm Uber's US business as cost of drivers is way too high here. In other countries, labor is cheap and roads will be difficult to do FSD anytime soon - so business will continue as usual.

comment,"Heres my stance, you dont have to agree. Tesla is our best chance in the near term at a sustainable energy future. No other EV company is able to produce them and make money (outside of China but theres a lot to unpack there). The""legacy"" OEM's lose money on each EV they make, plus they lose the profit they would have made if they were to sell an ICE vehicle in its place... New EV companies are still struggling to scale and also lose money on each EV they make. Not only that but Tesla is solving battery storage on the grid with their ""Megapacks"". True sustainable energy. Now, I consider supporting Tesla part of my core liberal values. I find their CEO's politics toxic. But as long as they are making EV's that are made in the USA and are profitable, they are doing good for the planet. A billionaire CEO is almost inevitably a narcissist, huge EGO, thinks he can solve anything, etc... Part of the package.

Then, as far as the stock is concerned, if you believe they are on the verge of solving autonomous driving like many do, and see that they are scaling their semi truck production, an autonomous robot that can work in a factory and your home, as well as a robo taxi fleet of millions as soon as regulation is approved, etc, the stock is a no brainer for massive growth as WS hasnt priced these forward looking aspects in yet...

comment,"Teslaâ€™s current valuation relies heavily on speculative growth narratives around robotaxis and Optimus. While Elon Muskâ€™s vision has captivated investors, the lack of tangible progress in these areas raises serious questions about the sustainability of Teslaâ€™s stock price.

In the short term, investor optimism and momentum may keep the stock elevated. However, in the long term, Tesla will need to deliver concrete results to justify its valuation. If it fails to do so, the risk of a sharp correction is significant.

Teslaâ€™s stock appears to be a classic example of the ""greater fool"" game, where speculative optimism overshadows current fundamentals. For now, the paper gains may look impressive to many investors, buoyed by Elon Musk's ambitious projections of trillion-dollar valuations driven by robotaxis and humanoid robots. However, when the narrative fails to materializeâ€”whether due to slower-than-expected progress in autonomous driving, increased competition, or unmet expectationsâ€”the correction could be swift and severe. Such a downturn would not only erase the illusion of paper gains but also leave many investors facing real and substantial losses as the market recalibrates to reflect Tesla's actual performance rather than its aspirational promises.",2/5/2025 8:03,jkbk007,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ihlwb0/tslz_for_the_time_being/,0.9044,reddit

post,"Political Impact?
Just a quick question - Is anyone concerned that some of Elon's political activities could impact the stock negatively? Just like his media build up helped him in the fall, is there a chance that his current political activities could reverse the trend here? I saw an article today that some of the institutional shareholders were beginning to agitate for Elon's removal from Tesla for that reason. Would love your thoughts. I get the message on FSD, Robotaxis and Robots are the future, but that future is a long ways off from a revenue perspective. I'd guess that real robotaxi revenue won't be impactful until 2026 or 27.

comment,"Congrats and welcome to the investing world. I personally would not choose Tesla as my first stock but it could be good for you. Tesla is fun to watch and a roller coaster with all of the EM stories in the market, but it's tough to actually analyze seriously since the stock price is very disconnected from fundamental analysis of financial, sales, and performance information. My experience is that it trades a bit more on enthusiasm, and less on market performance -- which is okay, but something to go into with your eyes open.

Do you remember Elon 10 years ago? Was almost exclusively loved by everyone. He is not the same man he was then. He is forcing people to choose sides and that can only have a negative impact on his businesses. When you alienate one whole party it will have an effect.

Institutional Shareholders could care less about Elon - they don't trade on emotions. Ross Gerber is good example of one that does (and his fund is negative in the largest bull market in history).

Cooperation and interpersonal relationship can be hard for him, according to his latest biography. If Trump and Elon has very different opinions in some political issues. Given both Trump and Elon believe in themselves so strongly, this may lead to serious conflicts and his resignation. 

Second, the conflict between Trump and China may lead to the conflict between Elon and China. A huge part of Tesla business depends on China. China is a country where the government has the power to control everything, which is completely different when comparing with the US. Tesla is allowed to produce cars in China directly and in a tax-friendly manner because Tesla may boost the EV industry in China. Now, the EV industry in China has already been boosted. There is no incentives for China to let Tesla to do business in China now. Overall, US-China conflict may seriously damage Tesla business in China since Elon is now a member of the government.",2/5/2025 22:33,Tctfcyvyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iijaxu/political_impact/,-0.8156,reddit

comment,"My suggestion would be to visit other non-Tesla anti-Musk boards and look through the comment section. Try and identify how many accounts have sub-100 per year karma. My guess is 30%+.

Then use that analysis and ask yourself if you are in an echo chamber and if it's affecting your investment conviction in the product or the company. That is what I would suggest. 

Reddit has no verification requirements. Scores of AI bots are trying to manipulate the stock, Musk's reputation, and most importantly political unrest. 

This is post-election season Reddit is being overrun. 

Then go on X - where almost everyone is registered with a credit card. VERY few anti-Musk comments by verified users. Any platform that requires registration and verification - you don't see the BS you see on here.

Your odds of winning based on news and online events is very low almost zero.Â

comment,There's nothing in the earnings estimates that indicates that the price of the stock will go up for any reason. Nothing much has happened since November and it was trading around $250 then. There was euphoria and momentum because of the election and about $500B of corruption got priced in. IDK how the company can cash in on that so I assume we will see a couple of percent price drop a day (with occasional runs) until we reach $250 or some real evidence corruption materializes in something tangible. Tesla managed to alienate much of their customer base the last few months and there's nothing indicating that car sales won't drop dramatically.

post,"I built a free TSLA Reddit sentiment analysis tool for r/TSLA
Hey! I'm Max, a Software Engineer from Singapore. I built a free web app to analyze market sentiments across Tesla-related subreddits.

This web app provides the following:

1) Sentiment analysis across Tesla-related subreddits to classify bullish/neutral/bearish posts & comments.

2) Trending keywords across different timeframes.

You can try it out at https://teslabulls.com! I hope you enjoy it, and I'm happy to hear feedbacks!

Why did I build this?

Tesla (TSLA) has been unlike any other stock. It's famous for its strong following and presence on Reddit, which, combined with Elon Musk's influence, have created a unique market dynamic of its own.

It has been frequently commented that Tesla doesn't follow the usual technical analysis and more of retail sentiments. I decided to try building this to see the trends and how it compares.",2/6/2025 12:10,pickandmix222,https://teslabulls.com,0.9755,reddit

In my time following the market, I think every single big tech company has been called overbought/overvalued. People said NVIDIA was overvalued at a 100 billion market cap and now it's over 3.5 trillion. I was new then.

I used to think of Tesla and Elon like everyone else here frankly, but I did my research and spent thousands of hours looking into the business.

comment,">  People all over the world now are boycotting Tesla.

Yeah, this will definitely have an effect, but it is difficult to judge how much exactly...

Specifically, if Musks cars really are *much* better than the competition, people might be willing to put up with it, because they don't really have a choice. They would possibly even talk themselves into ""why it's not such a big deal that the CEO is of Tesla is crazy"".

However, if they are only slightly better, then, people might emotionally choose against Tesla, because it is ""that somewhat tainted brand"", and ""I don't want to give the impression that I don't care about stuff"", and therefore might give Tesla a pass. 

At the very least, I am relatively confident that Musk will not be able to recover his reputation. The ""unfortunate gesture"" and the exchange and encouragement with Germanys modern defacto-Nazi party will not be simply forgotten in Europe in a year or two, no matter what he does from now on.",2/6/2025 17:45,HighDefinist,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iijaxu/political_impact/,0.9065,reddit

post,"TSLA is heading to 300-320
Update on 11 Feb 2025:
TSLA is approaching the 300-320 range I shared 4 days agoâ€”Iâ€™m starting to buy


Update on 10 Feb 2025: 
TSLA is currently testing a minor support zone at 345-355, where a few technical factors converge. If this level fails to hold, the stock is likely to directly drop toward the 300-320 range, a zone with a high probability of a strong rebound.


Original Post: 
TSLA key supports are in the 300-320 region. Some confluence in the 345-55 zone may generate a minor bounce before another leg down to 300-320. Bearish in the near term. Bullish medium to long term

Like most people, you probably read the comments when tesla went from a pe of 100 to 97. Thinking this derating was unjustified based on robots ""that are 50x harder to traiin that fsd,"" which has taken 10 years longer than expected and counting.

Fsd, which Elon just said won't work in China due to data for training issues. 

It's hard not to dislike elon, but he is doing me a great favour by ramping the stock price to exceptional levels. funding secured, then hitlergruss destroying any brand value.

post,"Losing $1500 in just 5 minutes
I bought a TSLA $340/330 put credit spread that expires on April 17th. Until 3:55 p.m. today, the optionâ€™s value was $3.40, but it surged to $4.80 in the last five minutes. This sudden price hike has significantly increased my overall loss. My loss was $500 until 3:55 p.m., but it skyrocketed to $1600 after that. Iâ€™m utterly baffled by this last-minute change.

comment,"You likely **sold** a put credit spread, not bought one. Buying a credit spread doesnâ€™t make sense. That would be a debit spread. Your max loss is **$660 per contract** (if you collected $3.40 credit). Losses canâ€™t just â€œskyrocketâ€ beyond that. The jump in spread value is just **bid-ask widening + low liquidity near close**, not an actual realized loss unless you closed the trade. Tesla at **$430 is irrelevant**â€”you just need it **above $340 at expiration** to keep the credit. This is just temporary price fluctuation.

I sold my entire position shortly after the 20th. And itâ€™s only dropped since then. 

Even if you didnâ€™t care about what he did, what heâ€™s doing, even if you genuinely didnâ€™t care, surely SURELY, youâ€™d think maybe other people will care, and this is a good time to sell? 

If you read the news, how could you be ANYTHING but bearish?

Secondly to this A lot of us donâ€™t want our money supporting someone who does things like theyâ€™re doing, itâ€™s important to us.

Itâ€™s the same reason we probably donâ€™t invest in Lockheed Martin or arms stocks.

comment,"Estimates? A lot is not factored in and some you need to dig a little deeper.

Tesla Energy? 2nd factory begins this quarter. They also announced a 3rd factory. This is material, especially since it's their highest margin segment of the business.

Deferred revenue - There is quite literally billions not accounted for in regards to FSD & Tesla energy but we know it will be in the future. Highly material.

Model 2/Q - We know this is coming in H1. This cannot be factored in atm but they have said a number of times this is a roadmap to 3m EVs annually. It has also been stated to be under $30k. This will dramatically increase their TAM.

They also mentioned ""vehicles"" to be announced in H1. Now it's possible this will include the Model Y refresh but I think that's separate and have a feeling it may be the Roadster.

comment,"Reddit keeps recommending this sub to me. Every time I see a post, it's ridiculously bullish, and I can see nothing but headwinds for Tesla. I see people saying ridiculous things, and this stock is overvalued af already, and Musk is doing nazi salutes? Way to completely piss off the entire European market for one thing, plus their cars are shit quality compared to car makers that have been around for over a century and know what they're doing. I've worked with tesla on a professional level and their engineering is totally shit. They have garbage qc and it shows in their products. I wouldn't buy one, and in a few years, everyone will have heard enough stories about how bad their products are to know better than to buy them. The only way their products will improve is if Musk is replaced, and if he's replaced, the stock will crater. You can't win. Well, you can win if you buy puts, just don't ask me how long this house of cards will be able to remain standing.",2/7/2025 2:34,KryptoBones89,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ijbzhh/why_so_many_bears_on_here/,-0.9803,reddit

comment,"You got me at ""Tesla as a company is solid"".

1. Tesla has declining EV sales across every region of the world it delivers to, is consistently outpaced by the Chinese EV market so goodbye to the second largest market on the planet. India also will never allow a Tesla factory to be produced there neither are the current prices cheap enough for the corridor. Goodbye to the third largest market on the planet.
2. Elon has consistently pushed back his deadlines year after year after year. FSD in 2026? Robotaxis in 2028? Google Waymo has already achieved FSD long ago. China has already achieved public-use robotaxis 2 years ago. Even GM pulled out of the robotaxi race because it is just not sustainable to build these cars at the current cost prices per vehicle - only China can achieve these levels of cost reductions due to their completely localised supply chain.
3. Elon recognizes point 2 and decided to invest in sex robots to be delivered by 2027 (if you believe that), a full 90 degrees shift away from his original focus.
4. CyberTruck release has been a complete flop. Nobody is buying that. Their target are people who want trucks but people who want trucks actually want a real truck.
5. Ignoring every big flaw in the above 4 points, Tesla has ALWAYS been overvalued, largely drawn by the public interest and scrutiny of the company and its CEO. Right now not only are the prices still absurd, the general sentiment of Elon is negative and nobody is really talking about TSLA nowadays.
6. TSLA's trading volume was always at the top across all stocks due to significant trading/investment interest. Right now not only has it been surpassed by NVDA, it is also 10% lower.

Financials are a miss, technicals are a miss, copium is not even at a high, sentiment is poor, interest is low. I wish you luck and fortune brother.",2/7/2025 8:33,F2PBTW_YT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ijomuh/im_in/,0.6094,reddit

comment,"

If Tesla's EVs are the best on the market, why are they slashing prices? Why are their operating margins being squeezed? Don't tell me it's just to gain market share or make their cars accessible to lower-income consumers.

The truth is, Tesla is adapting to the competitive market pressure from Chinese EV manufacturers. This shows that Tesla doesn't have as wide a moat with their cars as some might think, although they do lead in data collectionâ€”much like how OpenAI has an advantage in AI data. However, even OpenAI's dominance is being challenged; a $6 million investment in a small Chinese company has produced competitors that are driving down margins for OpenAI. You need to be realisticâ€”this data will likely be replicated or stolen one way or another. And BAIDU use robotaxis since a while now and they are **IN THE STREET** .

And when it comes to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, there are many Chinese companies working on similar technologies. I recommend you check out this video on YouTube titled 'Unitree vs Deep Robotics Robot Dog' to see how quickly the margins in a 'disruptive' new industry can shrink. The competition in robotics is heating up rapidly and even if elon make a break throught it ll not be the only one.

I think you had a great ride on this narratives for the last 5 to 6 years but now reality will knock at your door, and rÃ©ality smash really hard people driven by illusions and narratives.... like reeeeaaally hard \^\^.

comment,"Because FSD and it's licensing isn't as big a cash cow as you think it is.

China already have self-driving that is better than FSD (Huawei ADS 3.2), with most of the other big Chinese brands all developing their own (even vision only like FSD), to the point all popular Chinese brands will have self-driving capabilities in a year or two. And many of the Chinese brands are focusing on two tracks for self-driving, those backed by sensors (Lidar, Radar, Camaras combined in the same physical packages, the cost is literally $200 more over vision only) for a more premium solution, which allows them to create a more aware self-driving software stack (something Tesla gave up getting to work (Camaras + Sensors), and those with vision only (budget self-driving) just like FSD.

You can see the progress they have made here:

Boicot on EV will hurt ofc but... I don't think it'll last forever. California and Europe are off ofc but anything can change. Elon is not stupid.

So why am I not bullish? Because Tesla has a... history of delaying  deadlines. I will be honest guys: bought when this was wayy too high and totally consider it one of my biggest mistakes in trading.",2/7/2025 12:38,merindosi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iju1ek/highly_doubt_this_goes_for_long_term/,0.8209,reddit

comment,"I agree. This will likely be a hard year. The traditional focus has been on car sales. The major highlight will be the new compact which will be announced soon, and I hope it is released soon after. Model Y sales could bounce back in March as the new model goes into production. 

Energy is amazing but itâ€™s not the primary focus of WS. I think it should get more attention but unfortunately it doesnâ€™t. Thought it would last year. Perhaps this year?

Everyone in retail is focused on FSD but Iâ€™m more skeptical. Adoption by car owners will likely be slow especially as itâ€™s expensive and people donâ€™t mind/want to drive so theyâ€™re in control. Robotaxi is hailed as the â€˜next comingâ€™ but I hold a view similar to Gary Black in that it is a bonus but will be replicated. Again user adoption will be slow giving competition a chance to catch up. Maybe we hear some licensing deals which is big but will take OEMs years to incorporate into production as thatâ€™s just how they work (NACS announcements which is relatively simplier were a year ago). 

Iâ€™m keeping a close eye of Optimus. If ANY robots start to do something meaningful in production and there are ANY actual sales this year, this is a whole new revenue line and likely a new focus by WS and earning calls.",2/7/2025 14:33,conndor84,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iju1ek/highly_doubt_this_goes_for_long_term/,0.9539,reddit

I'm in since Sept 2015 but just trying to figure out the future for a company that is a second mover at this point...behind in autonomous driving, behind in robotics, ahead in power distribution, but losing share.  margins have dropped, sales have dropped, and new vehicle releases are boring at best (3/Y) and offensive at worst (CT)...they have coasted on the lack of competition, but that lack of competition has changed in the past 4-5 years.",2/7/2025 15:28,fourdawgnight,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ijbzhh/why_so_many_bears_on_here/,-0.7845,reddit

**So in 2021 TSLA's ATH was 407 and within a year it dropped to 113 which is huge crash**  
**almost 70%**

There was few things that happened that year, that we might see happening again! except last one.

\-Elon Muskâ€™s acquisition of Twitter in late 2022 led to concerns that he was too distracted. **(Now his political interest is creating uncertainty and the market hates it).**  
\-Reports of declining orders and price cuts in key markets raised fears that Teslaâ€™s growth was slowing. **(Now the sales plummeting in EU is creating the fear among investors).**  
  
\-Musk sold a significant portion of his shares (around $22 billion in late 2021), causing temporary price drops.

Other than the 22 billion sell off, we have almost same cycle repeating  
Do i think it will crash again? **NO**

post,"Prediction: TSLA will drop and bounce off 100 DMA in the next week
Studying the charts and have a prediction.  Next week will be quite ugly as selling accelerates and many capitulate. We will dip slightly below the 100 day Moving Average for a day or two, which is currently at 333 and moving upwards about 1 - 1.5 points a day. Short term bottom will be in sometime in the middle of the week before we start a several-week bounce up to 400 or slightly above, then the next wave will take us much lower to 300 or below.  Basing this on the how the charts looked when TSLA hit a relative high around 300 in July of 2023.  From that high, it downtrended for 9 months to less than 50% of that high in the 140s, so definitely donâ€™t think itâ€™ll reach new highs anytime soon, but a bounce is not too much to expect.  I do expect it to go down to around 250 before the next multi-month uptrend.  Just my analysis and prediction, and Iâ€™ll likely be wrong, but I think itâ€™s reasonableâ€¦",2/8/2025 2:31,OutlandishnessDry365,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ikcsjg/prediction_tsla_will_drop_and_bounce_off_100_dma/,-0.7431,reddit

comment,"In the UK and I believe other countries, EV sales depend heavily on â€˜salary sacrificeâ€™ schemes whereby the company leased the car for you, and income tax credits subsidised the lease. 

Dealerships are reporting excess used Tesla stock (go and check on Autotrader or Carwow in the uk), and the cars are devaluing faster than other EVâ€™s (who all have this problem) due to the excess used stock. With the residual value dropping, the leases for new cars are going to get more expensive.

Tesla could slash prices, but this could exacerbate the problem - a Â£50k Tesla might lease for the same monthly cost as a Â£65k VW due to residual value drop.

Additionally, they are an insurance nightmare due to the lack of servicing and the way the components are replaced compared to other manufacturers. This could be bad, because while Tesla arenâ€™t just a car company, the realities of having thousands of cars on the road are inescapable.",2/8/2025 12:58,Hairybow,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ikcsjg/prediction_tsla_will_drop_and_bounce_off_100_dma/,-0.872,reddit

Consider this a learning experience. Never listen to analysts, they are just noise. Always have a plan to manage risk. Holding a stock while it declines 18% from your purchase is a risky strategy. Now you need a 22% gain just to break even.

That said I think TSLA is at an important level right here right now. 360 is where the stock broke out in December. If it loses this level, it is likely it will go quickly to the 345 area, and if that doesnâ€™t hold, 320 may be next.

TSLA is a meme stock, not trading on any reasonable valuation to its EV business, so it rides on the hopes and dreams of Elonâ€™s future. With his latest shenanigans putting a drag on sales, it is quite possible this stock will continue to underperform.

It has become very sad to have a company we love associated with all of these politics we want nothing to do with, and it is causing a lot of unfair backlash for families who have been long term bulls. 
These hillbillies are not investors IMO, many are the same ones who have tried to steamroll us off the road in our CT with our kids in tow, and are not driving Teslas and for sure not investors of the stock!

comment,"If fundamentals alone dictated markets, prices would move in perfect proportion to news or earnings every time. But they donâ€™tâ€”because emotions, perception, and herd mentality drive price action.

Traders like Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Richard Dennis have used TA to build fortunes. Spend some time learning it before making bold claims.

comment,"You seem well versed. What is the business model for Autonomous FSD and Optimus? Optimus I'm thinking you just sell a lot and provide subsequent servicing, but I'm wondering who the buyers are. With FSD, I just don't understand how the money is made. The take rate is currently very low for private vehicles and then who owns the autonomous car? Does Tesla or is it a private buyer? If you use an overlay of Ubers business, they barely make money and don't even own have the overhead of the car maintenance. So Tesla won't profit from it, but maybe private buyers will own the car? So you buy the car and just send it out? I agree with you on the potential of batteries, but I'm not sure if resource availability growth is exponential though.

post,"PLEASE HELP - Is this a good TSLA hedging strategy???
Iâ€™ve been holding TSLA for several years and remain a long-term bull. However, due to the recent volatility caused by Musk's political involvement, Iâ€™m considering hedging my position by **buying an ATM put with an Apr17 expiration.**

*My reasoning* \- if the stock price continues to decline, the put will help realize gains, but I plan to close it before expiration since **I want to keep my shares**. Iâ€™m choosing April 17 because TSLAâ€™s next earnings report is on that day, and Iâ€™m concerned that a post-earnings surge could significantly reduce the putâ€™s value.

My main concern is the **rapid Theta decay (-20)** and the initial cost of $2,800 for the hedge.

Is anyone else using options to hedge a long position? Iâ€™d love to hear about your strategy! Any insights would be much appreciated!!!",2/8/2025 23:49,FinanceGirlie666,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1il1azr/please_help_is_this_a_good_tsla_hedging_strategy/,0.9687,reddit

post,"Advice on selling TSLA
Hey yâ€™all

Would like to ask for some advice regarding selling off of my TSLA shares. Just for context, here are the deets:

Total shares owned - 132.3853

Average price - $186.28

Cost basis - $24661



Somewhere in 2023 I started selling options on TSLA and my current open positions are

Mar 21 335P

May 16 305C

Like many others, I am bearish on the short term outlook of TSLA and I think itâ€™s time to take some profits and wait to reenter at about my cost price again 


I know many TSLA bulls will taunt me - itâ€™s ok, Iâ€™ve made my peace with it if it never drops to my cost as I know there are plenty of other opportunities. I just think that after 2 years.. itâ€™s only right to take some profits now before the price goes below my call. 


I am thinking of 

1. Rolling out and down my put option
2. Taking profits on my odd no of shares (32.3853)
3. Wait for my 305C to be exercised

However, on point 3, i am worried that the price drops too fast and itâ€™ll go below the strike by expiration in May. In that case, would closing the call position early be a wiser decision? Or to make it even more clean cut, close both options and sell off all of my shares? 

I would really appreciate any input from experienced traders here. Thanks for your time! 


Before i get grilled for the weird looking put and call: 


Yeah, i know its weird that my call is lower than put, mismanagement on my part caused me to not roll up my strike in advance of the elections and i was caught with my pants down (had no connectivity, was in the air) and the price went wayyy up. been rolling it up slowly from pre election strike of 250 to this current level, paying bits of debit here and there, which i am ok with.

comment,"This is something to consider. 360 is a potential major support area. If it holds, you would be selling near an intermediate low. Even a dead cat bounce could get as high as the 390â€™s before rolling over.

Of course, this could all change quickly with a gap down tomorrow, as it was trading below 360 post-market.

If it were me Iâ€™d wait for the open. If it does not get back above 360 quickly it would seem prudent to lock profits, especially if overall market is weak. If 360 is lost it seems likely 345 will be next.

(But going to hold on to mine for now) And Trump likely helps slow down EV adoption in the US as well.

I have also kinda lost the excitement for Tesla, because they are no longer leading the way in EV tech. They have lost the efficiency crown, the range crown, the charging speed crown etc.... They got great software though and cheap production. CT has some nice tech, but was the wrong car for now.

Still got some resistance though. Because selling TSLA feels like a breakup lol",2/9/2025 17:16,enRchi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ik70fb/chill_out/,0.9214,reddit

comment,"Almost no retail analysts are pricing in Robotaxi or the Bot into their price target models. They're just not. There's a large premium being placed on Tesla as an AI play both in the Robotaxi and Bot space, but nobody has actually calculated what the revenue from Robotaxi or the Bot would be.

Robotaxi is estimated to be a trillion dollar a year industry. If analysts had factored that in Tesla would be worth 10 trillion dollars with a normal PE. The bot is worth trillions per year. Pricing the bot into price target models puts Tesla at a laughably silly valuation. But that's because Tesla's potential growth is absurdly high. Higher than anything we've seen since the invention of the steam engine.

comment,"â€œObserversâ€™ job, as they see it, is simply to identify which external events caused whatever price changes occur.  When news seems to coincide sensibly with market movement, they presume a causal relationship.  When news doesnâ€™t fit, they attempt to devise a cause-and-effect structure to make it fit.   When they cannot even devise a plausible way to twist the news into justifying market action, they chalk up the market moves to â€œpsychology,â€ which means that, despite a plethora of news and numerous inventive ways to interpret it, their imaginations arenâ€™t prodigious enough to concoct a credible causal story.   

Most of the time it is easy for observers to believe in news causality.   Financial markets fluctuate constantly, and news comes out constantly, and sometimes the two elements coincide well enough to reinforce commentatorsâ€™ mental bias towards mechanical cause and effect.  When news and the market fail to coincide, they shrug and disregard the inconsistency.   Those operating under the mechanics paradigm in finance never seem to see or care that these glaring anomalies exist.â€ â€“ Bob Prechter.

comment,"A lot of TSLA holders think anti-elon is just economically insignificant. I would have agreed in previous years, but not after the election and certainly not after the nazi salutes.

European sales are responding as I would have guessed. US sales I guessed would suffer 10-15% loss and then possibly snowball more as the brand ""Tesla"" gets completely undermined. 

In previous years, it was Musk making troll statements that only pissed off the woke crowd, and Tesla owners/stockholders could shrug and look at the overall company perf.

Now? Cybertruck is basically a dud. Semi is still in prototype. Sales are collapsing even before nazi salutes and right wing europolitics meddling blows back completely. Daily bad headlines from DOGE. Sparked war with China that may lead to Chinese goverment seizing Tesla and undermining subsidies to EV infrastructure and directly to car sales. Rudderless absent leadership. Double-down on AI hype that company has a track record of failure in. Lack of diversity of product line/models/trims.

There is simply too much failed leadership and execution since the Model Y to justify this company's stock price and even more directly, Elon's continued ""leadership"" of it. 

I think a lot of the hype-buyers simply don't appreciate the significance of the seig heil and the nuclear bomb that lands on the brand value of Tesla. Tesla was a major brand, as was Musk. Musk is not Trump, and bad publicity is not good publicity in Tesla-land. 

The brand is mortally wounded. I really struggle to think of an equivalent destruction of a brand that still survived. Maybe BP after the gulf oil spill? But oil is an inelastic demand industry, so I can see them riding it out, and really that was probably US-only. Papa John's survived by ditching their CEO. 

This is a worldwide destruction of a brand. Tesla is a high-margin luxury carmaker fundamentally. You cannot be in that business without a good brand. Tesla has no alternate brands, subsidiary badges, etc. So destruction of the Tesla brand is destruction of Tesla's sales.",2/10/2025 23:30,Holy-Crap-Uncle,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iju1ek/highly_doubt_this_goes_for_long_term/,-0.998,reddit

comment,"Full disclosure I dumped beginning of week for various reasons. 

Iâ€™ll just say that if you looked at TSLAs sales numbers and just replaced the word TSLA with Costco, Amazon, Nike, Apple, Nvidia, Starbucks, Toyota, McDonalds or whateverâ€”what do you think the effect on the stock would be?

And if any one of those stocks had that news, those companies would respond immediately. Has TSLA even acknowledged this?

The answer to your question is what is the reality/cult equilibrium here? What is the tipping point of the fanaticism accepting the reality? Because thatâ€™s the bet thatâ€™s being made at this point. The point at which the people losing faith in the never ending promises that do not materialize, the hyperbolic price targets and the illusions of a future that really has nothing but a delusional sales pitch holding it up?

And if you believe that 'buying the white house' is a buillish signâ€”quite the opposite. If you were sitting on the 20 year EV headstart, and the full-house of FSD driving data and AI, why would you need to stack the deck with trying to buy Open AI or manipulating policy to get ahead?

comment,"â€œIâ€™ve been in Enron (Tesla) stock since before 2000â€ is not the flex you think it is. It speaks more about your luck than to the viability of Tesla

Tesla is an awfully managed company with no future, and the fact that you are an early investor wonâ€™t change that. Just like Trump Media company rises from the ashes, itâ€™s absolutely not because of sound fiscal management but because his majority owner is now president. Same with Elon, Tesla stock will continue to grow until his very public divorce from Trump",2/11/2025 4:47,MindAccomplished3879,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1imlomp/no_one_cares_if_youre_out/,0.3142,reddit

comment,"I was a shareholder since 2018. I used TSLA stock and option gains to buy a model 3, two model Xs, and a cybertruck. I completely exited the stock about a month ago. The first crack I witnessed was when I tried to buy my mom a Model X and she told me she wouldn't be caught dead driving one (a few years ago she would say how much she'd love to drive a Tesla but couldn't afford one). I thought she's probably just in the minority and just hates Musk and is very sensitive to Nazi apologists. Then I started hearing the same thing from my friends. Pretty much anyone left of center won't even consider purchasing a Tesla because of Musk. I thought okay, maybe now people on the right will be interested in electric cars. Nope, I spoke to a bunch of friends and family members who still believe all the propaganda from years ago about how electric cars can only go 100 miles and need to charge for 20 hours at a time, worse for the environment than gas (as if they care), etc. So then I thought ok it's just the US, people outside the US don't really have an opinion of Musk. Welp, that's not true anymore, his public Nazi salutes have gotten him some nice worldwide attention and sales are down there too. So after enough rationalizing I realized this is not the best place for my money anymore.

post,"Thoughts on Powellâ€™s Hearing
Currently watching the hearing, and it feels like **80% is about Powell, interest rates, and inflation policy, while 20% is a panel discussion on Elon Musk (Co-president?) and DOGE**. I never expected Muskâ€™s name to be mentioned this frequently in a Fed hearingâ€”itâ€™s starting to feel more like a government innovation forum rather than an economic hearing.

But the **market isnâ€™t taking this as a jokeâ€”itâ€™s reacting in real-time**.

Indexes are climbing, but Tesla is underperforming and decoupling from the broader market. If tomorrowâ€™s CPI comes in as expected and rate cut expectations remain low, indexes could reverse downward. That would put Tesla in an even worse position, as itâ€™s already in a downward trend. If the broader market dips, Tesla could see **even steeper losses**.

Considering the **Day 2 hearing sentiment**, expect further volatility. Time to stay alert.

comment,"When discussing support levels, I primarily refer to closing prices, as they provide a more reliable confirmation of a breakdown. Intraday dips below support can happen due to volatility, but what really matters is whether the price closes below the level and sustains that move.

That said, if there's a high-volume intraday breakdown with strong selling pressure and no meaningful recovery by the close, it can still signal further downside.

comment,"â€œObserversâ€™ job, as they see it, is simply to identify which external events caused whatever price changes occur.  When news seems to coincide sensibly with market movement, they presume a causal relationship.  When news doesnâ€™t fit, they attempt to devise a cause-and-effect structure to make it fit.   When they cannot even devise a plausible way to twist the news into justifying market action, they chalk up the market moves to â€œpsychology,â€ which means that, despite a plethora of news and numerous inventive ways to interpret it, their imaginations arenâ€™t prodigious enough to concoct a credible causal story.   

Most of the time it is easy for observers to believe in news causality.   Financial markets fluctuate constantly, and news comes out constantly, and sometimes the two elements coincide well enough to reinforce commentatorsâ€™ mental bias towards mechanical cause and effect.  When news and the market fail to coincide, they shrug and disregard the inconsistency.   Those operating under the mechanics paradigm in finance never seem to see or care that these glaring anomalies exist.â€ â€“ Bob Prechter.

China has surpassed, and that doesn't matter to the US market, but it does to the rest of the world, esp China which is/was Tesla's second biggest market (not sure Tesla can hang their hat on USA anymore either).  Passing the red face test on if Tesla is still a tech company vs an auto company with an energy play is going to get pretty tough in the next 3-6 months.  once they lose the tech badge they will be over valued by 900%-1000% (at today's price), bringing them in line with other auto manufactures and energy producers...they have lost any brand good will due to Elon, sure, but that isn't their only problem.  their numbers are going in the wrong direction for growth.  margins shrinking, sales/orders/deliveries falling off a cliff (this is not a supply chain or new vehicle issue).  
It seems pretty clear that Elon is not interested in Tesla anymore.  he will continue to play figure head as long as his ego can take it, but he has moved onto other shiny objects and doesn't really care what he burns down in his wake.

If you know what's really going to lead to decreased deliveries and Q1 and want to try to do some trading based off of it, go ahead and try to catch the falling knife. I think it's actually very doable here.

But believe it or not, nothing has changed about the fundamentals of the company. And there's a reason all the institutional analysts have been raising price targets recently.

But remember, when Tesla hit $108 in 2022 people were saying it was going bankrupt.  Within a month the stock doubled.

But, how good can the margins be?

Why?
I doubt it.
Elon is unfocused.

And the ideas are out there for other companies to catch up who have more focused CEOs.

Tesla is unique in that it announces shit super super super early.

But, robots and self driving as not just Tesla.
Most companies just want to be more sure that they will be able to release on time before they announce.

post,"Tesla hedging with long puts
I have 167 stocks which i bought around 388-400 

I was thinking of Is anyone here hedging their Tesla position right now with long puts? I was thinking of buying about 6 contracts of the 260 put with an expiration in a month and a half. The premium comes out to $1,800, and if it crashes to around 220, Iâ€™ll have a net profit of $24K.

It was deep enough that, at a loss, I could buy my calls back.  If the ones in my cash account had been called away, it would have triggered a tax event that would cost me $37k.

Only a fraction of January was after the inauguration issue, and less was after his AfD speech. His involvement in the attempted overthrow of the US government will hurt sales at home. You even have Trump voters in streets on weekends protesting Musk. You should expect February's numbers to make January look amazing. At this point there is nothing else Tesla can do. The Internet now refers to Tesla's as Swastikars... That's a stink that can not be undone. A slightly revamped Model Y will not undo the damage.

What is a fair price p/share for a car company that might be lucky to move 400k units in the coming year whole posting massive loses? Look at the fundamentals of Tesla and look at consumer sentiment.

post,"Elon needs to do calm down.
I love Elon and everything he is contributing to human advancement. But he should understand that if enough people are irritated by what he says, things wonâ€™t turn out wellâ€”even if the end product is incredible.

I think Elonâ€™s success and his never-give-up attitude, which brought him this far, wonâ€™t serve him well in ideological matters. History provides many examples. Hereâ€™s a horrible one: under dictator Gaddafi, Libya was a stable and relatively prosperous nation. All he had to do was keep calm and continue his work. But he didnâ€™t, Western propaganda took its toll, and he was ultimately killed by his own people. Now, Libya is a terror-infested failed state (any historian, feel free to correct me if Iâ€™m wrong).

People perceive Elonâ€™s companies as an extension of him, and his ego has ensured they remain that way. To hurt Elon is to hurt his companies. Tesla is an unusual company in that its products have traditionally been favored by left-leaning consumers. But now, with the left seeing Elon as a right-leaning figure influencing politics and ideologies, itâ€™s common sense that consumers would opt for the next best alternative, ultimately affecting Teslaâ€™s sales.

The worst part is, I donâ€™t think Elon cares much about what happens to Teslaâ€”at least from a stock standpoint. He seems to believe there are far more important things to worry about, and heâ€™s even willing to risk his companies to achieve them. Heâ€™s not necessarily wrong, but he could pursue these goals without harming his companies and investors. If he could set aside his ego and resign from his leadership position at Tesla, instead taking on a design/engineering role, I think people wouldnâ€™t focus so much on Tesla. If not that, then at the very least, he should talk less and focus his energy on DOGE, etc.

(P.S.: This is just my personal opinion, filtered through internet sources and surface-level information. Feel free to enlighten me if Iâ€™m wrong.)",2/12/2025 4:28,godjizz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1inirfz/elon_needs_to_do_calm_down/,0.9179,reddit

Any long term investors buying the dip? Iâ€™m holding out for 250 but also concerned that may not be the bottom. I have 103 shares Iâ€™ve accumulated over the last 4 years.

post,"Not Worried About Tesla At All
Seeing a lot of FUD lately. As a seasoned investor in Tesla, I've witnessed the rollercoaster that is TSLA's stock journey firsthand. The current chatter about selling or panic seems to predominantly come from bots and those who jumped on the bandwagon at its peak around $480, now witnessing their savings diminish.

Let me share a personal anecdote: a few years back, I liquidated my assets, including my home, and reinvested it all into Tesla during a hype-driven peak of around $280. The stock then plummeted to $120, yet I remained unshaken. Why? Because those who truly understand Tesla's vision see beyond the volatility. 

Consider this historical parallel: investing in Apple during the '90s when its stock hit rock bottom. Those who trusted in Steve Jobs' vision were handsomely rewarded. Tesla is on a similar trajectory, poised to become one of the world's leading companies.

Despite facing significant headwinds from activist short sellers, a mostly hostile media landscape, and global regulatory challenges, Tesla has consistently pushed boundaries. Tesla's product lineup is diversifying further and their investment in vertical integration continues to drop COGS, protecting itself from supply chain issues while simultaneously growing their footprint.

The current dip in stock price is merely a blip in the grand scheme. For those looking at the long-term, Tesla represents not just a stock but an investment in the future of mobility, intelligent automation,  and energy. The narrative is  exponential growth in the coming decade.

My advice, buy now. That's what I'm doing. Buy all the way down and back up. Personally, I think we'll see another stock split before 2030, maybe two.

I think it would be hard for Elon to suggest more government funds for Tesla/space X while he is cutting back on others. I think a continuation of the trump tax cuts might be a positive for stocks if they can pass them through again (big if). Sales for Tesla are not great and the cyber truck is Teslas first big flop. I also think Elon has lost at least half of his customer base. To me it seems clear that going long on Tesla right now is a huge Risk.

comment,"BYD will surpass Tesla in every way in two years if Elon doesnâ€™t refocus (I donâ€™t think he will). Also, the alignment with Trump is scary as I see Elon becoming his scapegoat much like Rudy Giuliani was. The rest of the world is watching and 1Q earnings could be alarming given the news of sharp international sales declines. Also, liberals have historically been the customer base for EV purchases and Elon has given them the middle finger. We know that Tesla truly is a data and tech company and not as much auto industry, however, Elon needs to appoint a CEO for Tesla for things to turn around, but I donâ€™t think he will ever relinquish power. There are many risk factors and uncertainty with not a strong future guidance to compete in the future, imo. Heâ€™s one or two major incidences away full the stock free falling, but he has all the ability to turn it around if he refocuses back on Tesla",2/12/2025 17:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ijbzhh/why_so_many_bears_on_here/,-0.5111,reddit

Andressing your argument that the ship has sailed is false. How much has Tesla expanded since the start; Fremont was the start that led to China, Germany, Texas, Nevada, and lathrop California. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m missing many other factors about their growth but your argument that heâ€™s distracted is also a false narrative.

Assuming Elon wins the appeal on the Delaware compensation case he will hold a 22% share in Tesla. He has said repeatedly that he wants 25%.

He wants MORE shares, not less.

Also, Elon is worth about $400B, of which only about $170B is Tesla stock.  About $150B is SpaceX (probably more since nobody was even willing to sell shares at the last valuation offering), $80B between X, Neuralink, Boring Company and XAI. Then he's got about $100B just in other investments.

In no world does he need to sell Tesla stock to buy OpenAI.",2/12/2025 22:02,baldwalrus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1inphu7/will_elon_sell_off_tesla_shares_to_fund_his/,0.8674,reddit

also - this is going to wreak of crooked ass shit that will likely create even further delays...if it is over 5 years that is $80M a year at best, figure 50%+ will just be fore service and parts.  
furthermore, and not a small issue, the CT absolutely sucks off road right now, so they will have their work cut out for them.  
one final bonus, CT heavily relies on cameras, which will be a shit mess to care for in the desert or the jungle...

comment,"You couldâ€™ve bought the low at $320. Maybe itâ€™ll go back to $320, maybe itâ€™ll shoot up to $400. No one knows exactly. Itâ€™s the long term game. Buying now you could say it was good if it goes higher or you could say it was bad if it goes lower. What if it drops to $330 tomorrow but then rockets to $420 next week? Are you going to be upset you bought at $340 because it goes down to $330 this Friday but then past $400 next week? What if you buy now at $340 and it goes up to $500 in a few months? Are you going to be upset then? What if you wait to see if it goes down to $320 but it only goes down to $330 next week and then by next month itâ€™s at $450? Are you going to be made you didnâ€™t buy it sooner rather than later? Itâ€™s all perspective. No one really knows. It could go down more and in the not to far distant future it could go up more.

From what I'm seeing, the official Request for Proposal hasn't been released yet. The conflict is because the government release originally said, ""Armored Teslas,"" which suggests it won't be a competitive bid. So they changed it to ""Armored Electric Vehicles."" 

But I've been in the industry long enough. If they want Teslas, they'll make the requirements perfectly spec'd to a Cybertruck or whatever so nobody else can compete. ""Vehicle shall have an 816V nominal, 150 Ah structural battery pack weighing no more than 1,591 lb. The battery pack shall have an energy density of at least 170wh/kg and be capable of charging at a maximum rate of 350 kW at 800V DC power."" etc.",2/13/2025 13:07,sabotnoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iohigu/tesla_potentially_securing_400_million_contract/,0.8678,reddit

The only logic is in who has their money where and when. Any market value that has anything to do with the performance of the company is based solely on perception of that supposed performance.

As long as people believe the myth, or behave as if they do, the reality distortion field around tesla remains. There is nothing real, or anything that will actually become real in the future, that supports this irrational faith in tesla or the supposed ""genius"" of It's leader.

Any investors who actually believe that something like functional robots, that are anything more than expensive toys incapable of doing valuable work that couldn't be done better and much more cheaply with a purpose built device like those that people have been making for over a century, will be sold within five years, let alone ""next year"", are part of the cult.

Also the ""more affordable vehicles"" are coming as well. Tesla is being extremely quiet about those, but previously said they'd launch this year. Imo they don't want to say anything more otherwise they risk tanking their M3/MY sales as people wait for the cheaper models.

post,"Is the new Juniper Y any good?
I haven't had a chance to see one live yet and curious if its any good. Note, I am a Tesla owner, but I've looked at the new BMW's and Cadillac's and both were better than our family Y from an interior / ride perspective. The BMW was a bit over priced but the Lyriq was actually fairly priced and had a better interior. Curious if it's worth waiting for Juniper or just time to say my goodbye to the big T. If the competition out there is better than Tesla's new stuff, maybe it's also time to get rid of the stock too. By the way, I'm new to Reddit -- not a bot.

I will answer for myself. I believe that Tesla offers the greatest risk vs reward in the market because of FSD, Semi, Megapacks, Optimus, Cybercab.

comment,"Follow your own advice. The bearish settlement is also found in the places you have been looking at. Reddit being one of them. Do you know we are currently below the 1 year average analyst price target? If all of your news came from Reddit, youâ€™d assume this stock would be less than a $100 dollars by end of year and it should trade like a â€œcar companyâ€. As Dan Ives states, â€œTesla is the most undervalued AI companyâ€. And Reddit not understanding this is the biggest understatement. Iâ€™ve covered this stock during insane swings to the upside or downside but ultimately the overall thesis has stayed the same or gotten betterâ€”at one point humanoid robots was not part of Teslaâ€™s future so this was a bonus in terms of AI application and potential. 

Donâ€™t worry about Elon either. Elon will continue to say whatever controversial thing he likes on twitter, continue to dabble in a variety of other things and people will continue to say he is distracted and he is hurting the business. Teslaâ€™s leadership will continue to pursue its goals and innovate and trust me Elon will step in when the time is needed for him too. Elon has executed on impossible odds and as a believer in the future involving Tesla, he will continue to do so (if you donâ€™t believe in this, do not invest). Elon is the vision of this company and will guide it when necessary so do not be concerned with â€œhow little he spends the time at the companyâ€. With the support of the president, current administration and tailwind of deregulation, Tesla will continue to chart a future into the sky. Continue to hold unless there is a critical change in the overall thesis of,most importantly, Elonâ€™s future of Tesla. 

One other thing to note, you are horribly timing this stock if you attempt to sell and buy in at a cheaper price. We are way too close to FSD in Austin by June. This stock can swing violently up and you will unfortunately be buying at a higher price than when you sold it if you time this wrong. I get the reason behind it.

He's alienated left-leaning potential buyers to the point where it's unfashionable to have a Tesla. And the right leaning customers? They hate EVs to begin with, and that doesn't appear to be changing. So we drop a huge percentage of potential customers and don't pick that up anywhere else. Just a straight loss.

I don't think he's been doing a great job as CEO. At the same time though, I'm not sure a replacement CEO would actually increase the stock price, or even keep it stable.

comment,"Do I care? Noâ€¦ most CEOâ€™s donâ€™t work in the companies theyâ€™re â€™CEOâ€™s forâ€™ in the first place

They spend time flying around in private jets, vacation, etc etcâ€¦ Elon does he take vacations? Yes of course he does.

But how often? He canâ€™t afford to take vacations. Heâ€™s running like 5 companies & has a crazy amount of kids.

Heâ€™s a beast in AND out of Tesla. That guy, knows what heâ€™s doing minute by minute incrementally.

He doesnâ€™t have to be involved in Teslaâ€™s â€˜day-to-dayâ€™ operations. 

All he has to do is make single decisions, just like heâ€™s doing w/ Doge or Space-X or Starlink, or the Boring company, Xâ€¦ or whatever else he has going on. 

Itâ€™s not about whether or not heâ€™s working â€˜withinâ€™ his company or if heâ€™s â€˜notâ€™ working in his company. Itâ€™s about whether or not the decisions he makes effects his companies result in net positive outcomes.

Grid storage will be dominated by LFP, Sodium Ion, and other lower cost chemistries that Tesla has no experience with. Repackaged old car packs only goes so far. 

Their CEO did a nazi salute on TV. Brand is DEAD in europe / US regardless of tech magic, and it is not coming back.

Idk why more people aren't investing tons of money into Tesla (that I know in person)",2/14/2025 6:08,Vibraniumguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ip2it1/full_ported_25k_into_tsla/,0.6815,reddit

comment,"I dont agree with Musks behaviour with that salute or being childish and bullying on media etc.
He has some personal issues, some diagnosis etc...whatever may be the case.
I dont condone it, and at times really dont like the guy.
But I came to terms that he is smart, looking at the business growths he achieved with all, not just tesla.
Looking at his with separate views, business and personal, he is what he is and will never change.

But that aside, you'll have your view and I have mine.
In the ends its up to each one and their decision, I'm gonna view Tesla, not Musk, in the new way with their products and potentials.

But one and formost lesson I've learned is, NEVER underestimate or bet against tesla/musk. They/he usually come out as the winner.",2/14/2025 6:19,Nepoznatijunak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ip2it1/full_ported_25k_into_tsla/,0.7772,reddit

Musk knows that Tesla is not going to sustain and is onto his new toys now. Unfortunately there are some very smart and hard working people that work for Tesla. But sorry. Youâ€™re boss is bored and would rather act out in the worst middle aged crisis baby boy way possible.

Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™ll go back up, for you. But I didnâ€™t buy any shares before and neither will I now. Tell me why I should without mentioning Elon Musk. Tell me why did you, without mentioning Elon Musk lol.

People will recommend you something, doesnâ€™t mean they are right. At the end of the day, those guys are just doing the homeworks for you.

Heavy Sell volume confirms Downward trend 

Moving Average nearly parallel to previous upward trend

Moving average intersects with previous upward trend + current downtrend around 287

Marked High, recent low, and projected max Low of 287 ( similar to above poster mentioned 294 so my findings are nearly the same)

Also notice the downward trend repeatedly bouncing off resistance 

If it bounces off 360-370 again its extremely strong indicator that downward trend continues.  If it goes past 360, will probably see a trend reversal.  What we see in this volume is a lot of distribution from MM and Institution to retail ""hoping"" for an advance and getting burned. I bought puts a while ago that are paying off big at the moment and I believe will continue to climb, based on above analysis. I Think it would be wise at this point to liquidate and short sell, or at least wait to see what happens with the 360-370 resistance level.",2/15/2025 17:55,new_reddit_user_not,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iq1zo0/tsla_whats_your_thoughts_will_we_retest_350_or/,0.7902,reddit

comment,"Here are my bearish points:

1. TSLA is declining in sales in their main market, China, and getting outcompeted faster by other EV makers in the country (BYD and many other dozens of EV brands). Market share is only 6% in China and trend is falling. BYD is also releasing FSD for all their cars, even those as cheap as 10k **for free in 2025**. Tesla? 2026 reportedly, but they had already claimed FSD to be released in 2021 and continues to delay on their ever-growing list of promises. 

2. Perpetual delays in pipelines. From Tesla Semi, CyberTruck, FSD, Robotaxis - everything was promised and repromised again and again and while the CyberTruck is now released after 4 wasted years, it is not doing well at all even if it is the best selling EV ""truck"". I say ""truck"" because red necks and hillbillies don't actually want to drive a CyberTruck. As of today, Tesla **IS** a car company and continues to be a car company until it delivers on its promises. The pricing is barely justifiable even for a growth tech company - which it is not. A little nugget of detail is GM already pulled out of the Robotaxi race, so I have no clue what superior strength Tesla, a weaker car company in financials, has over the massive GM.

3. Sales in India is basically a dream at this point, so that is the second large economy that is failing for Tesla. And then there is Europe sales falling YoY like a [hot knife in butter](https://www.motor1.com/news/749660/tesla-sales-results-january-2025/). Not to mention certain large pension funds in Europe already sold their holdings of TSLA which was a nice passive price pump gone.

4. Elon's reputation. Regardless of what he did or did not do and say, the truth is TSLA is Elon and Elon is TSLA. Any reputation break screws the dynamic he brings to the stock and the hype that his investors have. Taking a strong political stance only distances himself from the opposing side which further distances himself from the other parts of the world that shares those opposing view points. Reddit being a left-leaning echo chamber only exacerbates the negative sentiment he receives as this is probably the most popular forum there is on the internet right now.

5. EV credits are now gone from the administration he is fighting for, and big states like California is not giving local EV credits for Tesla car purchases, further slowing the race for Tesla. Tesla cars will also potentially [face a 100% tariff for imports into Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-tesla-tariffs-1.7455273) \- but who cares right? Sales in Canada was bad to begin with.

6. Tesla [did not even make the top 10 in car sales in 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/). This is not a surprise seeing as their market share fell from 2.2% to 2.1% between 2023 and 2024. But I dare say a decrease in market share is a huge hit for a company that drives (punny) on growth and slowly but surely beating the competition in sales and technology.

This may obviously grow if prices were cheaper, but so far the experiences of Waymo and Cruze, indicate that the running costs for Robo-taxis are not that much cheaper than conventional taxis.

I think Robo-taxis will be far more difficult in Europe, as roads will be far more difficult for full self driving. In poorer countries, labour costs are far lower and difficult to see it working. Maybe Japan will be a good market?

comment,"TSLA to me is an all-or-nothing stock, betting on autonomy. Right now weâ€™re at this crossroads where we donâ€™t know whether they can definitively do it or not. In fact, for the stock to skyrocket, it will have to fulfil these criterias, else, it will be worth a lot less than itâ€™s worth now

1. Solve both driving (FSD) and robotics (Optimus) autonomy
2. Do it before anyone else

The next step would be to do technical DD on whether both (1) and (2) will happen. I donâ€™t consider myself as an expert specifically in Computer Vision or Driving Perception, but I do know enough to understand and reimplement research papers in this area (given enough time ðŸ˜…). Iâ€™m fairly confident (~70%, but thatâ€™s my opinion) that Teslas approach will allow them to achieve them. My technical reasons could be a separate post/discussion altogether haha

Notice that I have also not set a timeline of these outcomes of skyrocketing or plummeting. I believe that this will be a step-change kind of situation, and hence I am long. I do not know if it will happen within a year or 5 years, but until something technically changes (eg new research breakthroughs from other companies), Iâ€™m continuing to hold. Also notice that Iâ€™m not saying that TSLAâ€™s current technologies can achieve autonomy, but rather the approach they take (deep NNs, data and compute scaling, etc) can eventually take them there. I want to be holding on to the stock when that happens

But of course if Iâ€™m wrong then the stock plummets. Hence when people ask me about TSLA, I always say itâ€™s a potential game changing stock, but I donâ€™t allocate more than 20-30% of my portfolio on it, and Iâ€™m ready to hold it long. For people who need the money for the next 1-2 years, I wouldnt recommend it, and also people who are looking to earn money in the next 1-2 years - as it could drop or stay flat in however many years it takes, then make that step change.",2/18/2025 11:06,charpi123,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1is9tpi/tsla_bulls_what_is_your_bull_thesis/,0.8264,reddit

Compared to previous paradigms where we need to ""collect as much data as possible"" to train a model, now it seems that we just have to ""collect as much *edge case* data as possible"", that cannot be simulated. How much of such data do we need to achieve the threshold of safety we need, I do not know. And to be perfectly honest that's my ""bear"" case for Tesla's approach to autonomy, where no matter how much we collect, the real world gives us endless unique edge cases that is not part of the training data.

Figure.ai is a competitor. But I think competition is great for multiple reasons (innovation, increasing demand). In fact having 0 competitors in a space for too long can be sign of something else.

Regarding FSD, this one is so hard to say. We have not solved it yet but are getting to a point where we are increasingly less impressed by its performance,  but only because it has gotten so much better.
Others may solve it first (e.g. China). What does solving mean is a little unclear though. But this might be ok.

Regarding edge cases, I guess it's more of that we cannot fathom the every type of edge case that is possibly encountered when driving, as if we can, then it can be simulated :) For example, a truck with a red traffic light painted on it might cause the model to interpret it as a real red light and slam the breaks to stop (this is an outlandish example of course). :)

You mention delays but many of these things are NBD's. Never been done. And FSD isnt just a ton of sensors and HD mapped algorithms, its AI thinking and making decisions like a human driver would. I think they took the hard path to FSD and it took a long time but according to the company, its about to roll out and will be seen as the ""correct"" solution to the problem.

On Elon: There was all this buzz all weekend about protests at Tesla showrooms but when you look, they were pretty small. And this morning, the Monday business news didnt even mention them. Musk has been rubbing people the wrong way for a long time, its baked in by now... In essence though, in a pretty evenly divided society, he switched sides.

comment,"> As for robotics and being the first to implement robotics, we already have many companies with years of headstart like Boston Dynamics. I don't like to keep propping China but they've also been able to make cheaper robots and will be pushing FSD this year. 

First, BD doesn't have any realy AI solution for it's robots, it take tons of training and programming to have them be useful where they are used today and i see no signs that will improve any time soon.

The bigger issue, for both BD, China and any other competitors is manufacturing.  Tesla has shown they can scale and scale fast, and make a profit doing it.  BD will likley never get there, other US competitors don't have any record of it as they are startups basically.  China *should* be able to compete and do it, even if less efficiently, but when that can happen is questionable.

comment,"Here's another point of view. 
1. Tesla's declining sales in China may be a thing, but it may not. The lunar new year was early this year, and basically shut down China, along with retooling for juniper.  Orders for Juniper are soaring. So the slowdown could well be due to Osborneing the Model Y, and New Years. 
Also BYD's God's eye is being misreported. There is a free version, just like autopilot is free, but that version isn't even as good as autopilot.  And to get time full version, you have to pay for extra hardware, as well as the optional software. TL;DR, it ain't free, and it ain't as good as FSD. Meanwhile, Tesla is rapidly closing in on Level 3.

2. You're right, everything has been promised repeatedly, and deadlines have been missed. But as long as they're continually working on it, eventually they will actually deliver.  The past isn't a reliable indicator for the future. The Semi is going into production now. And if the economics are right, they have the ability to manufacture a lower cost model by using the cyber cab platform and adding a steering wheel and pedals. And they've said they will have additional low-cost models this year. 

No stock valuation is ever based on past earnings, it's always based on future expected earnings, and future earnings aren't a car company. There is no profit to be made selling low cost cars.  Legacy sells them only to get repair revenue, which doesn't exist for EVs. So the reason to sell them is FSD.  Combining megapack earnings, FSD earnings, and robot savings, makes them not a car company in the future. 

I say robot savings, because they likely won't sell any for at least two years, but they will use thousands in-house, which will reduce manufacturing costs further over their already existing lead in lowering costs. No other auto manufacturer can make a car as cheaply as Tesla. 

4. Elon's image is hurting Tesla. But ultimately, boycotts don't work very well. And businesses never care. Businesses will buy Optimus if/when they are shown to be cost effective. Canada tariffs aren't likely to happen, that's just bluster. Trump doesn't gaf about Canada imports, he just wants Canada to become another state, and that'll never happen. 

6. Car sales are irrelevant. Margin and profits are. Tesla is (probably) the only auto maker that can sell BEVs at a profit despite Hyundai saying otherwise (without proof). As for technology, Tesla mostly is pushing tech in manufacturing where they are a leader, and in AI, where they are also leading. Ford can sell 10x as many cars at a loss as Tesla sells at a profit and they'll go bankrupt. 

None of this is to say the stock price is justified, that's all based on what the automation market actually proves to be, which is anyone's guess.",2/18/2025 23:12,gibbonsgerg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1is9tpi/tsla_bulls_what_is_your_bull_thesis/,0.9176,reddit

comment,"What reversal. Elon killed Tesla sales in Europe, Canada and Latin America.

In China he will never be allowed to outshine local brands. Here we are weeks into second Trump's term and in Europe the 3-way race between EU brands, Chinese brands and Tesla became a 2-way race overnight.

Australia/New Zeland is flooded with Chinese EVs

Politics aside let's look at numbers:

Sales of Cybertruck: crap.

Numbers from Europe: -50%.

Factory in Berlin: Wasted money.

Pointlessly trying to save the day by building a factory in India because China is slowly pushing him out.

Other Elon products: People are deleting X/Twitter left and right.  Starlink - nah since it became cleary Elon likes to play with on/off switch for certain parts of the world a bit too much nobody in their right mind will invest in that.

Steel price in US... Going up because of tarrifs.

Chips (for car industry too) made in Asia are now 25% more expensive.

Steel and chips... Oh yeah you need that stuff to build a Cybercrap. Whoops.

EDIT: Hey MAGA guys why is Elon building a factory in India weeks into Trump's second term? But but Detroit but but hard working folks that just want a job to buy those expensive eggs.

I would be shocked if eventually all of US Teslas end up being imported from China and India. Shocked I say. 

South African Nazzi would never exploit the fact that they work for couple of cents each hour, that there are no unions and that the steel is cheaper than in US... He would never I say.

comment,"Lol. CyberTrucks, while the best selling EV truck (whatever that even means), only amounted to 34k in 2024, out of a grand total of 41mil SUVs sold in 2024. That is only a market share of 0.0829%, which is only 0.0386% of all vehicles sold in 2024 (88mil). 

Also, just give it a minute of thought on the potential market share of Cybercabs. How long will Tesla take to recoup its cost of producing these vehicles solely for cab rides? Will the cab fares be greatly reduced versus Uber/taxis? The market cap of cab companies only amounts to \~100bil - where is the bullish take on Robotaxi then? Furthermore, in what situation could Tesla Robotaxis even compete in the real world outside USA where strict regulations revolve around FSD? Some roads in major cities and tier 1 countries aren't even well paved, let alone allowing a camera-based FSD system direct it around. The constant car crashing due to FSD should have rung some bells in that head of yours by now. The bullish optimism on FSD is a dream and will never be a reality.

Optimus going for 30k USD? So just for factories then? Good luck competing against actual robotics firms for that. Don't even get me started on their premature AI (grok) and how it is already decades behind ChatGPT.",2/20/2025 4:13,F2PBTW_YT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1itkwbu/dead_cat_jump_or_reversal/,0.9717,reddit

comment,"You're looking at Cybertruckâ€™s initial production numbers in a vacuum without considering ramp-up. Every new Tesla model starts with low volume before scalingâ€”same thing happened with the Model 3 and Y, which are now among the best-selling vehicles globally. Comparing its 2024 sales to total SUVs is irrelevant when production is still ramping.

As for Robotaxis, youâ€™re assuming Tesla is competing directly with cab companies when the real opportunity is in disrupting them, just like Uber did to taxis. The TAM isnâ€™t just the market cap of current cab servicesâ€”itâ€™s the entire transport sector that autonomy could upend. FSD improving with real-world miles is a fact, and if you think strict regulations are a barrier, tell that to companies already running AV fleets (Waymo, Cruise).

Optimus at $30K? Thatâ€™s a fraction of industrial robotics costs, and if it delivers even half of what Tesla envisions, itâ€™s a game-changer in automation. And Grok being 'decades behind' AI? Itâ€™s built differently with real-time inference on Teslaâ€™s compute stackâ€”perfect for autonomy, robotics, and energy AI, not just chat.

You can call it 'kool-aid' all you want, but every time Tesla announces something ambitious, bears say itâ€™s impossibleâ€”until it happens. They said the same thing about the Model 3 ramp, Gigafactories, FSD Beta, and Cybertruck.

comment,"There are some positive signs 
1) The model y pre order early estimates are looking positive in China and counter to the narrative that overall sales have been down in January. Which makes sense given Q4 was record deliveries, if the MAGA/DOGE was the main reason, the we would have seen that in Q4 deliveries as well which we did not expect maybe in Europe. So it does seem 8to be the Osborne effect more than anything
2) The engineers in Jay Leno review of model Y spoke about how theyâ€™re ahead of schedule for the robotaxi launch in June in Austin and every FSD review of the latest version seems in line with what they said 
3) Assuming Tesla gets viewed by the left as anti to what they stand for and becomes a political symbol for the right, could pave pathway for more people on the right to buy Tesla to prove a point just as the ones on the extreme left would choose not to buy to prove a point. If it happens it will open up to more markets that are typically associated with pro gasoline cars.

The last point maybe a bit far fetched, but think it might swing the other way and we might see more Tesla sales from predominantly right wing states like Texas to counter any loss from California.

Yes, everyone in every country thinks and feels the same things all the time and are in lockstep with the mainstream media. There are never any alternative opinions.

comment,"Thank you for your comment. I'm aware of the revised model Y, with its new styling and roughly 20 miles of range increase (same battery size). This will cause some amount of people to wait.  
  
I doubt the Model Y caused the decline in sales last year, and it's a bit dubious to claim that introduction of a new vehicle would cause a 56% reduction in Europe. China's 7% is also high, but more plausible - even if other companies are increasing sales substantially in the same time frame (BYD increased roughly 47%, a difference of 54% from Tesla's 7% decline). BYD is also releasing new models this year.

There's nothing to suggest that Tesla sales will break the declining trend, but, since the decline seems to be accelerating, I would love if you could share some sources to show why you're thinking a model Y introduction would cause a 56% sales decline in Europe.",2/20/2025 20:48,AstamanyanaQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iu2q5s/any_signs_from_us_tesla_stores_that_sales_have/,0.9032,reddit

comment,"I think you're framing this in a way that leans more on political emotion than objective fact. The idea that critics are making Tesla owners into villains isn't necessarily realityâ€”it's a perception shaped by the current political climate. Thereâ€™s definitely an echo chamber effect happening on both sides. Back in 2020, a lot of people thought the right had gone off the deep end with election denial; now we're seeing a reactionary response from the left. If Tesla ownership were genuinely linked to extremist ideologies, youâ€™d see countries with strict laws against such affiliations banning themâ€”yet Teslas are perfectly legal in places like Germany, where laws against extremism are strict.

At the end of the day, political narratives can get exaggerated to serve different agendas, whether for elections or public opinion shifts. But the idea that buying a Tesla puts someone at risk of being labeled or attacked feels like more of a social media talking point than a reflection of widespread reality.",2/21/2025 8:05,Bresson91,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iu2q5s/any_signs_from_us_tesla_stores_that_sales_have/,-0.3506,reddit

comment,"What's a ""decent chunk"" to you? Super subjective statement. More than 1/2 your portfolio? Money you can't afford to lose? Context is helpful. The stock market is just another casino. Assuming it's money you can't afford to lose, just put in an order to sell at $320. It's a roller coaster stock as anyone holding should know.

I think the anti-Elon stuff is overblown. Not sure more than like 10% of consumers factor in his views when making a purchase decision. Some clearly will but I think it's a small # and I think that stuff is already priced in at current levels. June will be a time to watch. If Austin Robotaxi goes and works the stock could pop. Haters will say (with some validity) it's geofenced, controlled, and staged.

Remember when there was that God awful event a few months back in LA where they debuted Robotaxi? Everyone hated it (myself included) and the stock is way up from that point. So anything can happen and to me it feels like the market is just looking for ANYTHING positive to make the stock pop.

And it's worth remembering Elon literally purchased the US presidency, and the ROI on that $300M will be huge for Tesla and is yet to come. Having the president in your pocket is a rather significant moat. 

I got in at $250 and have 400 shares. I've had it for 13 months (first half of 2024 was a kick to the balls - but holding paid off).

comment,"It's only been 30 days since Elon did the ... gesture. Not many people switch out their cars that quickly even if they intend to.  I've owned 3 Teslas, currently own 2 and I've been the biggest Tesla fanboy in my friend group ... and I can't bring myself to buy another Tesla as long as Elon is CEO.  My next car was absolutely going to be a Cybertruck until Elon started really going off the rails. I'm unlikely to sell both my current Teslas as a result of Elon because they are the best cars I've ever owned, but I know I won't be replacing them with Teslas when the time comes if he's still intertwined with the brand to the degree he is now.

I also initially thought that the Tesla hate was overblown and only on reddit, but my neighbor was driving her Tesla the other day and at an intersection someone threw food at her and shouted ""Fuck Donald Trump"".  There have been several Vandalism incidents in SF and elsewhere.  I've talked to many people who were in the market for a Tesla and now are looking exclusively at other EVs.  

I'm my own canary in the coal mine.  I drove a Model S in 2014 and saw how desirable of a brand it was I immediately started directing all my investment money into TSLA, and that moved my retirement up by about 20 years.  Now, even I hesitate to buy another one, and I've lost all enthusiasm for one of my favorite brands, so I've dumped all my stock.  Luckily it was over 400 when I did it, because I don't see it returning to anywhere near that unless the Elon changes course or the company divorces its image from him.",2/21/2025 22:14,moviemaker2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iuzbph/tsla_is_going_to_crash_to_280_without_a_doubt/,-0.1072,reddit

comment,"It is not just that Elon is hated - he is hated specifically by the client base for the Tesla cars. The most people who like him are not in the market for a Tesla.

Elon with his know-it-all narcissistic attitude has mismanaged the company and is screwing up its fundamentals:

1. The cybetruk while ""cool"" and what not, mostly appeals to tesla fanboys. It massively underdelivered on performance - it was supposed to be 500 mile range trick costing $50,000, and it turned out with half the range and twice the price.  It is unsellable in most markets outside of US because of its massive weight and inability to comply with safety regulations. Overall very expensive project to develop with limited market. 

2. The 4680 batteries took years longer to put in production for gains in performance that are below what was promised and can best be described as marginal. Again wasted time and money. 

3. Self driving is underdelivering, sucking large amounts of resources, and is years late (do you start to see a pattern here). I have serious doubts that it will ever work as advertised. This is due to artificial limitations imposed by Elon who insists that you only need cameras, his poor understanding of how humans drive, and his limited knowledge of what AI is and isn't. The ""Oh humans only use sight to drive, so cars should too"" argument is not true and shows fundamental misunderstanding of how humans use their eyes, what other sensory and non-sensory inputs they are using, and how much training outside of car driving lessons it takes us to be safe drivers. For the less educated: Tesla vision is not binocular so it cannot reliably estimate distances; Humans signal to other humans with hand gestures and sound; humans use their hearing, their knowledge of human behavior, and their life-long experiences to deal with other cars on the road and navigate corner cases that they have never encountered before; humans plan well ahead of executing based on experiences and the general conditions they observe or get clued in - FSD does not do that and I can't even imagine how much the model has to be expanded to do it.

4. Model 3 and Model Y refreshes are mostly token (if you ignore how they removed the stalks), and way too late because Tesla was wasting time and resources on Elon's pet projects - cybertruck, self driving and 4680 batteries. 

5. Everyone expected Tesla to capture the low end market with a cheap EV (The fabled Model 2) and they could have pulled it off quickly and cheaply if the company was not chasing Elon's unicorns. They are now supposedly going to release something like that but it may not have a steering wheel and be solely used as a taxi thanks to Elon's boundless wisdom. 

6. Elon is strategically undercutting Tesla. Remember how he fired the charger team undermining Tesla's biggest competitive advantage or how he dropped Tesla's allocation of Nvidia chips in favor of Xai? Now with his buddy Trump he is entered a trade war that will make everything used in Tesla for manufacturing more expensive - batteries from CATL, part assemblies from Canada and Mexico, lithium, graphite, copper, steel and aluminum from all around the world. 

7. The board in stuffed with Elon puppets, so it cannot serve as a check to the CEO, as it has demonstrated on more than one occasion.

  
I own a Tesla Model Y and I used to be long on Tesla, but sold all my shares (\~$30,000 worth) recently for the above reasons. I would advise anyone to sell now. No matter how good the cars are, if the company is mismanaged that badly I would not invest in it.",2/22/2025 0:22,Mountain-Crab3438,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iuu739/should_i_sell_or_hold_my_tesla_shares/,-0.6634,reddit

comment,"Tesla registrations are down in California at 12% and they had already started a decline so itâ€™s a YOY trend. Model 3 is down 36%. This is while EV sales in CA grew another 2%. There are also surveys suggesting that very few California Tesla owners will replace their Tesla with another, they plan to go to another brand. 

The other consideration for the stock is if the Trump administration gets rid of the carbon credit scheme, thatâ€™s over a third of Teslaâ€™s profit. Their vehicle profits are down and on a declining trend leaving their crypto as their main profit center which is not great.",2/22/2025 21:56,jaredthegeek,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iu2q5s/any_signs_from_us_tesla_stores_that_sales_have/,0.7909,reddit

comment,"Probably you all noticed that Musk with his politics is pushing to despair in the REAL WORLD, peoples that are extremely dangerous from every nutter part of the nations that exist: Russians, Chinese, his own Americans, not to mention Ukrainian special forces, and recently Europeans, but those ones are a little chill, but anyway.  
Everyone knows that big-mouth, low-IQ Trump is actually Musk's puppet and the nutters above could take their sorrow directly on Musk.

The queue list of rogue special forces nutters is too fricking long, to bet all of my money on TSLA and Musk's ego, or his dream of becoming a real-life Emperor, or whatever his plan is.

I really hope that his tech projects can successfully fly & run in time, and leave us a tech legacy that smart people could continue his work in space flight and Ev's.  
Probably is my personal fear investing all in on Musk, who is interfering in World's Wars, but I've got a feeling that only luck will save this man from his own actions.  
If this feels far fetch, ask yourself this question. 

Do you see this man today walking freely on a visit to Ukraine?  
if he turns and helps the Ukrainians, do you see this man walking freely in Russia?  
if Trump goes head on, on China, do you see this man in his factory in Shanghai again?

comment,"I say this as a self-proclaimed ""ex fanboy"" - I sold at 390, and I see little upside. Here there is no logic or analysis to be applied. The reality is that if all markets turn against Tesla because of Musk, and other competitors are indeed catching up, then TSLA will suffer. Whereas before, buying a Tesla was obvious in the EV space, it may no longer be so because of competition, and Elon is now making the prospect even less appealing. Yes, there's a lot of valuable tech in the pipeline, and the stock could recover, but right now, fluctuations are purely based on the car side of the company, which is, after all, the money maker for the rest of their ambitions. So if car sales continue to plummet as they are doing, I feel that so will TSLA. Again, this is fully dependent on sales, which are somewhat dependent on Elon's antics. In my view, he should be kicked out if he can't even control his posts on X. He can do what he wants, but taking down an entire company with the livelihoods of thousands is not on.

Let's look at markets:
US - many dems won't buy Teslas, Republicans in general never liked EVs.
Europe - sales down by 50% in most regions, time will tell how much is sentiment and how much is the MY ramp, but as a European, I feel that much of it is sentiment towards Musk.
China - shunning Tesla because of nationalism. After all, why buy a car from someone who is involved in pushing a trade war with your country?
So those are Tesla's biggest markets. What's left?",2/23/2025 12:30,SnooSquirrels4800,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1itkwbu/dead_cat_jump_or_reversal/,-0.815,reddit
comment,"Idk short term but long term, this is realization i made, people/media often say ""most people see tesla stock as car company"", and well i dont think the market really does, tesla's car company whether they make 2 mil cars, 1 mil, 6 mil or 15mil, has a potential of few hundred billions dollars market cap , it ain't small okay, but the stock is over trillion, the EV stuff is irrelevant. So ye sales drop here there and honestly i was afraid of that but im not anymore, like it doesnt really matter, yeah china is fierce, tesla wont be worldwide #1, they'll be there, usa's EV go to. Maybe europe will have some tesla's too, some in china. But there might be like 4 other main EV companies and tesla might be number 2 or 3. But the robotaxi & optimus ? I mean if they capture like a 1/4 of that worldwide, which is very realistic, I mean others will compete for sure but there won't be 1 monopoly, few main big players is what it's gonna be. If tesla gets a pie of that, it's trillions, with the margins they have ? Even if margins lower a bit etc, musk messed up some stuff and reputation, but if they release a cheaper vehicle, get regulatory approvals (musk will do that for sure), then they'll do fine and stock will be fine. But right now if sentiment changes, tesla stock can crash as hell, it's extremely overvalued short term, but who knows it might moon very soon aswell and not come back, so hard to tell. Really depends on what the market thinks.

China will support chinese competitor, usa will support tesla with bans & tarrifs, thats how it goes, each dominating their segment, maybe china get a big chunk of europe, but some people will always prefer american tesla.
Tesla's Robotaxi might be first before china.

comment,"A word from European/American who lives and owns places on both sides of the pond: Europe is in trouble (rightfully so in my opinion) and broke. Actually it will be super broke super soon and everything will be in decline when they will be forced to finally pony up money for their own defense and their own bills and crazy projects and agendas. No more sponsorship on the expense of the US tax payer. So tesla declines I see only partially as a revolt of the left in Europe against Musk, and more as an impending legit financial decline of Europe and it's citizens. Uncertainty, fear, realization that things have changed forever. United States must forge an alliance with Russia. Its been inevitable for decades. They have to work together against Chinese full blown take over. United States cannot afford Russis on Chinese side. So Europe is becoming irrelevant and lost in uncalled migration and bad ideologies. Self inflicted wounds. Nobody sane wants to support  that bottomless pit of nothing, especiallynew American administration. So as an investor in Tesla you will slowly have to start writing off the EU market, and look more towards new emerging markets, such as Russia and more conservative eastern Europe. Im beyond positive that that is where the US  money will flow in the future. It is a perfect symbiosis where they have resources and need development whereas we have a know how and $$$. Watch those markets grow very rapidly very soon, while EU will start losing social nets, free Healthcare, etc. Very few ppl will be thinking about buying 100k cars as their Titanic is about to start sinking real bad real soon. They are becoming irrelevant politically, economically and as a market, too. Heading to very broke. Hope this personal view helped you understand European market dynamics. Its more than just car sales. Nothing good will happen within EU at least for the next 4 years.",2/23/2025 18:40,fauxstarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iu2q5s/any_signs_from_us_tesla_stores_that_sales_have/,-0.4815,reddit

It sounds as though you have other feelings you credit for Tesla's continuing, substantial decline in Europe, and it's interesting to hear a different perspective.

I would appreciate any sources to backup your feelings on the matter - especially referring to Russia as an emerging market. I'm not sure how an enemy dictatorship (that's currently attacking a European nation) would become an emerging market.

comment,"The Cybertruck initial price was fantasy. They had not even designed the vehicle to be able to price it. Also, the original DM AWD price was supposed to be $49,990. The RWD was supposedly going to be $39,990. TriMotor was going to be $69,990. There was NEVER any way they would be able to sell a truck for $40K. That's just laughable. It was a typical bait and switch to get pre-orders and hold that money in an interest bearing account (millions and millions of dollars) or they may have just deposited the money in their day to day account and used it. If they truly had 1M pre-orders (which I doubt) that would be over $100M in free money. 

Elon has a long history of promising things that don't ever materialize. I mean we've been waiting for FSD to be L5 for 8 years... each year its just around the corner supposedly, but in reality it's not even close to L5. FSD is in my best estimation 10 years away from being what Elon said it would be by the end of 2017. It will require lots of hardware changes before then and even then 10 years may not even be long enough. 10 years in automotive time isn't long. They're still trying to get FSD to hit even 100 city miles per disengagement. Waymo has been over 10K miles for 5 or more years. 

Tesla has been offering huge incentives and if not for their emissions credits sales and bitcoin trades they would've lost money. Profit margin has sunk from the highest in the automotive world to about 6.5-7%. The discounts on Cybertrucks are because nobody wants one. They are hideous, slow charging, overpriced, have poor efficiency vs. other Teslas, and only offer about 55-60% as much highway range as a Silverado EV. The stainless body is also a PITA to clean, it looks terrible and shows every smudge or oily fingerprint, and not everyone wants to drive around in something that looks like a door stop on wheels. Add on Elon's far right turn which has alienated a huge percentage of the EV car buying public and you've got a recipe for a sales disaster.",2/24/2025 6:51,Mean-Marionberry-148,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iu2q5s/any_signs_from_us_tesla_stores_that_sales_have/,0.9022,reddit

If your tryna day trade TSLA, stfu, you donâ€™t know what ur sayingâ€¦ I remember when I used to be like you, day trading Tesla back in 2019-2020, then I grew up and decided to buy & hold. 2400 shares.

This subreddit is full of short term minded / herd mentality / non-research having ass mfsâ€¦ and the audacity, like you understand the complexity of how Tesla runs. 

You people are part of the reason I continue to hold thoughâ€¦ to me itâ€™s blatantly obvious the path ahead is up for its stock (by EOY it will pass $400 maybe even $500), by end of next year we are passing $600 maybe $700, by end of 2027, it is passing $700 maybe $800. By end of 2028, it is passing $800 maybe $900.

Where do you think the price is headed before the next bear trend?

Once people start to see him as the grifter he is (currently under way), his house of cards will all come tumbling down as it all revolves around TSLA having an insane 130 multiple. If the multiple came anywhere close to a standard car company multiple, or even dbl, Elon would be in bankruptcy as every one of his loans he took out backed by TSLA shares would be called due. He knew this, hence why he backed up the Brinks truck for Trump because he knew he could Hail Mary getting the government off his back and continue his charade of false promises.

Tesla's stock has dropped about 24.3% since November 2024 (from an estimated $400 to $302.80) and needs a further 57.13% drop ($556 billion in market cap) for Elon Musk to lose his richest man status, a scale of decline comparable to Nvidiaâ€™s $600 billion single-day loss in January 2025.

comment,"long term its going to go down hard.  Tesla in the end IS a car company, and while they had a first mover advantage they have squandered it by failing to deliver, and having other companies rapidly close the gap.

It also doesn't appear to be in the best position to corruptly get contracts like spacex and starlink can.  And a LOT of folks will simply never ever buy one now.  I have one, and am considering selling it to avoid the harassment.  I LOVE the car, but....yeah no.

And that consumer view?  Isnt just leftists.  Its Canadians. Its Europeans.  BOTH mad at the US, and very specifically at Elon.  Even if he got removed as CEO?  People wont forget.  So I think Tesla is going to keep going down for a long time as people realize its not delivering on promises, and decisions made along the way are making it even harder.  From refusing to use Lidar and thinking vision would be good enough, to not comprehending that they needed a LOT more hardware in the cars to deliver on the promises.  

The drug use by the CEO should be a red flag as well. You can see the paranoia as he tells the one mom that hes the #2 target of assassination after Trump for example.

comment,Tesla is cooked in the short term. Market in general is cooked. Too much foreign investment in the stock market. Musk is too close to Trump which for better or worse makes him a huge target to anyone that Trump ends up messing with. Too much downward pressure on a stock that was already way overpriced. I think long term Tesla is fine but market has Tesla priced today for what they would be valued at IF they do everything they say theyâ€™re going to do. I believe Musk will do it but itâ€™s going to be 3-4 years before that happens and the combo of an overpriced stock while Musk has a huge target on his back isnâ€™t great short term.

comment,"Get out while you can.

  
Tesla sells electric cars.   
  
You know who buys electric cars? Liberals. And just about every liberal on the planet is furious with Elon Musk now. Liberals are something like five times as likely as conservatives to buy electric cars. Nearly 3/4 of conservatives say they'd never even consider an EV. And the competition has gotten stiffer, it's not the same market it was a decade ago. There are too many other options to buy now, from someone who *isn't* doing these *heartfelt gestures* in front of millions of people.

Even foreign conservatives are mad at Musk, because he's front and center in the Trump administration which is randomly taking a dump on the porch of nations that are supposed to be allies, waging this idiotic economic bullying campaign.

Compounding that, Musk isn't even really running Tesla anymore. He's tweeting a hundred times a day and wrecking the US government's ability to function, which will trigger a general US economic decline.

**Do not confuse Elon Musk's gains with TSLA's stock price.** Musk stands to gain a ton from his direct control over so much of the US government's operations. SpaceX? Probably gonna do friggin *great.* Who knows what other contracts he'll poach. (saw an article about Starlink basically stealing Verizon's contract to do updates to air traffic control communications infrastructure)   
  
But Tesla is not SpaceX. Tesla sells electric cars, and the people who buy them are going to go elsewhere now. **This effect is not going to get better in the next 3.5 years. It is going to get worse.** 

And that's not even getting into how Tesla's line of vehicles is stagnating, or the dumpster fire that is the Cybertruck.

I didn't sell at a perfect time by any means, but goddamn am I glad that I did sell.",2/27/2025 2:19,exadeuce,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iz3awh/30_down_in_tsla_tsll/,-0.8933,reddit

comment,"If your brokerage allows shorting, and if you have a margin account. You just go to the ticker and put in a sell order, since you donâ€™t own shares the brokerage LOANS you the stock for a fee, you then sell that share on the market. Once the stock drops where you want it you buy it back, â€œclose the positionâ€.  You bought it back for less than you borrowed it at from your broker. The share goes back to your broker.

comment,"I think Tesla can get crushed even with Musk as shadow president. Like, recently the State Department put out a budget doc with a line saying they planned to spend $400M on ""armored Teslas""â€”and then after huge backlash they walked it back. But even $400M would be small potatoes compared to what SpaceX gets in government contracts. I think if Musk uses his position to funnel money to his companies, it will mostly go to SpaceX.

Plus, no guarantee Musk will stick around. One scenario that strikes me as fairly likely is Trump's cabinet could push him out because they don't want him infringing on their turf. Or he publicly melts down in some impossible-to-ignore way due to sleep deprivation and drug abuse.",2/27/2025 6:15,TopherBrennan,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iz3awh/30_down_in_tsla_tsll/,-0.9291,reddit

I also take a huge lost, Elon standing side by side with Donald Trump for Tesla stock owner it definitely negative affect on the company, but if you think about it, if trump's rating continues to improve it will definitely help Elon in a lot different ways on things that he wants to accomplish. I don't believe everything in the media. Im looking at chinese TikTok, most people are so thrilled about the model Y. I think the 1st quarter delivery is going to be crazy in Chinese market. some buyer delivery date has be push back to April. Do your own research, It will be a roller coaster for sure.

I'd say the opposite is more likely.  First, few people last very long in a Trump administration, second, everything Elon is doing is being seen as increasingly unpopular even among many who voted for Trump.  It's very likely that at some point Trump sees Elon as a liability, blames him for anything that goes wrong, and dumps him.  The brand damage Elon has already done will remain until he is kicked out of Tesla, which seems unlikely, unfortunately.

comment,"The P/E is based on flat sales and bitcoin against Q4 earnings correct? The stock has dropped, but that would only help P/E IF THE EARNINGS STAYED THE SAME. 

Ok, are the earnings going to stay the same?

\- Bitcoin was included in Q4, which according to the internet is $600 million, or about 25% of net income

\- EU sales collapse was not in Q4

\- US sales will drop, how much? I would guess 20%, but could be as bad as 40%. 

\- For the medium term post-Q1, will the regulatory credits for fuel standards disappear? I cannot see how it does not, with the Trump plans to drop CAFE standards. That represented almost $700 million in Q4 or 30% of net income.

BTC cannot be repeated each quarter, so that will come off the earnings. Q1 will probably get CAFE regulatory credits, but that will likely disappear sometime at the end of Q1 I would very shakily guess. 

That leaves collapsed sales to pull the earnings. This might get ugly.",2/27/2025 19:24,Holy-Crap-Uncle,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iykuhq/crashing_today_and_until_friday/,-0.9497,reddit

comment,"I don't think so. Why? Because I use FSD every day at this point and it's so good now that I can absolutely see it being safer than a human in certain cities already. That's why tesla is launching it geofenced. I think they can do June, you do not. That is the only difference between our arguments.

""It's insane to value Tesla high based on those possibilities at this point""
I also did not believe tesla was within 5 years of FSD when I had a free trial of version 11 2 years ago. Version 11 of FSD was ass. But they made a huge leap between 11 and 12 very suddenly, and 12.6.4 (the version I'm on) feels done. It's why I straight up don't believe Elon when he says that if they're being honest they'll have to upgrade HW3 cars to make them unsupervised FSD capable. I think the reason he said that is because, while the hardware is capable, developing 2 separate versions of FSD at once and maintaining them could be cost prohibitive somehow.

Regardless, unsupervised FSD not only yields profits for Tesla by driving up subscription rates for FSD, launching robotaxis for even half the price of Uber would yield massive profit margins. And it could be scaled basically instantly across the country once they're ready.

I agree with you that it could take longer than expected, but there will essentially be no warning once it happens. For me, it is worth it to invest heavily into Tesla (my stock portfolio actually recently became 100% $TSLA at an average price of $200/share) because it is not a question of ""if"" but ""when"".

And when robotaxis happen, it will augment many different aspects of Tesla's business at once, as well as I forsee robotaxis competing with even public transit. Even if robotaxis are a little more expensive than a bus, it'll take you right to your destination with (eventually) little to no wait times always. It'll be worth paying a slight premium to most people.",2/27/2025 21:04,Vibraniumguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iy14dd/reminder_to_do_your_own_research/,0.9755,reddit

comment,"Markets donâ€™t care about opinions, and neither do I. Support and resistance arenâ€™t guaranteesâ€”theyâ€™re probability zones where buyers historically step in. A support breaking doesnâ€™t mean it was never a support, just that sellers had the upper hand this time. Thatâ€™s why risk management exists, and why I trade levels, not emotions.

You â€˜guessâ€™ $240 without looking at technicals, yet dismiss TA as â€˜astrologyâ€™ while unknowingly using it yourself. Price history matters because markets are driven by liquidity, positioning, and psychologyâ€”not just headlines. Technical analysis isnâ€™t about predicting the future; itâ€™s about identifying high-probability setups and managing risk accordingly.

Muskâ€™s media drama is noise. The real game is capital flows, demand zones, and execution.

comment,"The bigger risk is likely just more Tesla is tied to Musk, who is tied to Trump, but the core market is rich people concerned about climate change; there is very little overlap of OK with Trump and buys EVs. Having the company tied indirectly to Trump is a big turnoff for the core customer base. On top of this Trump is really unpopular internationally in other rich nations, which will only get worse as the trade wars ramp up. Unless Elon can make Tesla the EV of choice for the right and get them to actually buy EVs Tesla is going to suffer. On top of this Trump is pulling back green policies many of which made EVs cheaper directly and indirectly, so it will be harder to afford them narrowing customer base even further.

Few weeks ago, I drove to the mountains here in So Cal and it navigated the mountain roads pretty well. I haven't experienced any sudden unnecessary reactions from the vehicle like I did 2-3 years ago.

You can't go on long road trips if you choose another brand, the Tesla charging network is extensive and well thought out. I did a whole 2 weeks road trip from so cal to the mountain to mammoth to lake tahoe and back to so cal about 2 years ago. Well placed chargers every step along the way. Zero trouble at all.

And honestly, who the f cares about panel alignment when your vehicle is going 70-80 MPH. Most people are going to care about convenience, ease of use and practicality.

TL:DR she said it would reach that price because:

* Tesla would be selling 10 million cars per year (vs. roughly 2 million in reality)
* Their profit margin would be 40% (it's near 8%)
* Robotaxi would be a significant contributor to their revenue (it has 0 revenue so far)

In my opinion the real reason it hit 480:

* Renewed hype cycle on the same old things (robotaxi and optimus)
* Short term investor memory on the last tesla bubble

1. Tesla is a great investment based on projected cash flows if they are successful in robotaxis or Optimus, both of which are looking very promising.

2. Tesla is in no way a startup. They have had positive cash flow for quite a while, and will continue to have them. In fact, the cash flows are so substantial, they will be able to make all these investments, without any more capital raises.

3. Like 99% of retail investors, if your understanding is this simplistic, you should definitely just stick with index funds. This is extremely serious advice.",2/28/2025 14:00,Kirk57,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j08396/simple_question_for_all_who_think_tsla_is_a_good/,0.9599,reddit

comment,"when the stock drops, most people are caught up in fear and dont have a bull thesis lmao; ask again when it rallies like fever again. The truth is Tesla is unique positioned to actually get regulations of autonomous vehicles approved, and it will have a distinct first mover advantage. The self driving is actually pretty incredible, and only chinese EV like Huawei can come close, other self driving software are mostly high way cruise control like systems. There is a moat around the software side that typical car companies will unlikely be able to compete with. 

For robotaxi, the cost to operate will be significantly cheaper than Uber, the big problem is really just vandalism and the cars being dirty AF because we cannot have nice things. That being said, for ""upscale"" communities robotaxi's is essentially a moving lounge, it does have interesting selling point, the nay-sayers are reacting like they would to any new innovation. That being said, FSD was not in a competent state so skepticism and safety concerns are definitely valid, but the system has improved so much in recent times it is actually imaginable to see robotaxi's being on call in busy city center or in airport etc. All in all, if regulation gets approved (more likely since Musk is following Trump like a puppy, so a favourable policy can come about at any time), with approval the stock can rally to 500 probably, because Tesla will become a ""Transport-as-a-service"" company rather than a car company, the autonomous future that Tesla tries to sell people on can become a disruptive revenue cow.

The uncertainty is still with how reliable the FSD will be when robotaxi launch in June, my money is that it will be better than what most people think, the AI rush in the last few years is what enabled Tesla to actually be able to do it; just look at how chatbot become so incredible over the last few months, i confess i am an AI believer, and driving is actually pretty ""simple"" considering what AI can actually do nowadays.",2/28/2025 16:13,afkgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1is9tpi/tsla_bulls_what_is_your_bull_thesis/,0.9811,reddit

comment,"I own both.  The charging is a problem with Rivian if you canâ€™t charge at home or have a long roadtrip.  The charging network for non-teslas just isnâ€™t there yet. 300+ mile range is more than enough for the majority of people however. The Rivian is far superior to my model y in nearly every way besides that.  The suspension in teslas is atrocious.  Driving anywhere with potholes must feel like driving in a power wheels car.  I live in south Florida so not a huge issue. Flooding is an issue however after heavy rains so the rivian ground clearance is a huge advantage over the lower clearance of the TSLA.  My kids are noticeably upset when I say we are taking the tesla when the rivian is in the driveway.  

I definitely donâ€™t plan on ever paying for FSD as long as I have my tesla because i donâ€™t want any incremental $s supporting Musk after his heel turn.  Also been shorting the stock with puts for the last month.  Doubtful I ever buy a Tesla again and if Trump cripples ev charger expansion, will just buy a gas car for rare long distance trips and drive my rivian everyday.",2/28/2025 16:44,NoContact7625,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1izqkq1/teslas_growing_unpopularity_and_the_future/,0.1329,reddit

I am so surprised many even on this subreddit with very interested people are so misinformed. Tesla model y sales are dropping... but why?

Sales have dropped because model y lines are being retooled, but the new model y has a waiting list. This was a planned simultaneous shutdown of all model y lines for retooling. Thats the way to do it, if you stagger it you get the osborn effect (reduced demand because of the new thing coming) and have to discount old models more. The new y will be strictly better in terms of value vs cost, so this is a good thing.

(And lot of exciting things may well happen soon. New megapack factory ramping in china. Everybody knows of the plans for june (robotaxi austin), the promises for the first quarter (release of new vehicles including more afforable model), ramp of semi, ramp of 4680s, fsd in china now, europe soon.)

comment,"China is a 10% market dip, so that is a 4% overall.

Europe will be 8-9% overall.

The US I'd guess will experience a short term 20% dip, so that will be a 10% dip overall.

So a 20-25% sales drop.

The issue is that there isn't a mass market car that is likely to arrive in time (Tesla has never delivered on promised delivery dates), and the sales drop is strongly structural in the EU and whatever happens in the US (the brand being fundamentally compromised isn't going away and still can snowball further). The Cybertruck is a dud, and models like the Ramcharger and Rivian pickup models simply will take the vast majority of EV pickup demand. 

The self-driving timeline remains laughable, whatever progress has been made. The reliability is five to seven ""nines"" of reliability from being viable, and one thing that AI has a big problem with is closing out those ""nines"".

Power/grid may have decent linear growth for a couple years, but utility-specific storage will eat Tesla's lunch. 

That leaves the Semi. The one true hope... but alas I think a functional mass market EV Semi requires solid state, sulfur, or some other power density/price combo that is 50%  better than what is on offer today. The fact it isn't even being used for limited transport runs is a poor sign of it being out of prototype. 

Going forward however, is more competition, more price competition, and the issue of a fundamentally politicized and compromised brand. CAFE subsidies will be cancelled by the Trump administration soon (may need to wait for the inevitable Musk ejection from Trump's orbit in a couple months).

So take the P/E as it currently stands, and AT LEAST increase it by 30% because of brand damage/sales. Now consider that bitcoin revenue is probably a single quarter book cook, and that was 30% of net income, so the P/E at current stock price goes up another 20-30%. That will be for Q1. 

Q2 I would guess they lose CAFE subsidies (1/3 of net income in Q4), and at best flat sales. That's another 20-30% P/E growth. So 150 p/e goes to 225 in Q1 (assuming no stock drop, a poor assumption) and then in Q2 may go to high 200s to almost 300 p/e. 

In a rational stock market, I would say it would be 100$, and that is still a LOT of AI hype.",2/28/2025 21:47,cowardlydragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j08396/simple_question_for_all_who_think_tsla_is_a_good/,-0.4614,reddit

Got an offer to join Tesla residential energy team as a P2 MLE. Wondering if I should take the offer given the drama around the company?

I have another offer from a trading firm SIG but that is more around building conversational bots for their backend team( mostly focused on building RAG pipelines).

Currently I am working at a startup in New York so I feel the Tesla brand name can be helpful in the future.

Or take SIG if you prefer stability, cash over stock, and a chance to specialize in NLP/finance. The $201k/year is solid (though less than Tesla), and staying in NYC is a perk.




Given your startup background and interest in Teslaâ€™s brand, I lean toward Teslaâ€”assuming youâ€™re fine with potential relocation and the chaotic vibe. Itâ€™s a bold move with bigger upside (resume, comp, impact), but SIG is a safer, still-prestigious alternative if Teslaâ€™s drama feels too dicey.

comment,"I donâ€™t get why people continue to evaluate tech companies like a boomer investing in a bakery. If you look at these companies and just think you can take their earnings and multiply them by 30-40 to get a price target, you wouldâ€™ve missed out on damn near every 10 bagger over the last few years. 

If you donâ€™t understand or like the tech thatâ€™s fine, but I never bought Tesla shares thinking that their car sales volume alone was going to make me rich (been in the stock since 2018). Just like how I didnâ€™t invest in nvidia by extrapolating their gamer gpu sales from 10 years ago to get my projected valuation. You either believe in the long term vision or you donâ€™t. Ironically I unfortunately didnâ€™t believe in nvidia enough because the stock ripped before I could even get a full position.

comment,"Morgan Stanley said Tesla Stock was going to $800. Why would they say that?  Because... Morgan Stanley owns 44,967,162 shares of Tesla (TSLA) as of its latest SEC filing on February 14, 2025, valued at approximately $18.16 billion. Sure they are going to say it will go up so they can get people to buy while they unload. The Trump bump was a greed play.

comment,"Very likely. Anti-sentiment towards Elon Musk is not going away, in fact worsening. Musk isn't spending more time on Tesla and seemingly isn't as interested in innovation anymore. Chinese competitors aren't going away either.

Trump's policies are causing a recession, building trade tensions, and his anti-EV policies aren't going to promote the sales of cars or EVs.

That leaves the energy business but trade wars and Trump's anti-clean energy policies are not going to help that either. 

So yes, I'd say there's a lot of room at the bottom. And good thing too because it's only when the stock tanks that the board will be forced to remove Elon.",3/4/2025 1:04,CatalyticDragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j2y3q0/are_we_still_going_down/,-0.7112,reddit

comment,"I think Tesla will need to get through at least 2 quarters of tough love from investors. Their 1st and 2nd quarter results will bear the brunt of declining sales as a result of slow to market innovation versus competition; see Byd as an example (search Byd Denza z9 gt in YouTube), higher-than-competition price points for more of the same type of models, slow to market face lifts, models and new tech, and Elonâ€™s current rep with DOGE.  Revenues and earnings will be materially impacted, now that Tesla will gain less cosmetic earning pluses from Bitcoin, emission credits, and prior years tax offsets.  

Tesla will need robotaxis,Optimus and the energy storage business. These will be Teslaâ€™s saving grace as these differentiate the company and help moon its stock. 

Tesla has a bad track record, of executing on time. This will be its bane and its stock will need Elon and his team to fully focus to deliver promises on time. Wall Street is impatient and unforgiving, so Teslaâ€™s premium will be questioned within 6 months if execution of promises are delayed. Elonâ€™s next upcoming two promises are 1) June autonomous robotaxis in Austin and 2) a new low cost model year end 2025. If these two are not delivered and the trajectory of sales continue its downward trend, be prepared to see a sub $100 Tesla price by year end.

comment,"It displaces a brand new Tesla sold. Someone who buys yours means one less person is buying a new one from Tesla. One person doing this makes no difference, but if a lot do it, then it depresses the price of Tesla on the used market, making the purchase of a new Tesla comparatively a lot more expensive. Not only because of the large gap in the price, but one also must consider the larger amount of depreciation as soon as it is driven out of the Tesla shop. To quote Elon, buying a new Tesla quickly becomes a â€œfinancially insaneâ€ thing to do.

That being said, if selling your Tesla is not something financially prudent for you to do, then donâ€™t do it. I still have mine. Instead of selling it, I donated offset money to causes I believe in, such as ocean cleanup funds, and I urge friends to consider a different EV other than Tesla as long as Elon is at the helm.

Never mind people not buying Teslas because they don't like Musk; who's going to be buying new cars in this climate? People who didn't sell last week are already regretting it. Things have been on a stark downward trend as is.

comment,"The PE at the moment in the high 130s simply does not stack up with reality. There is no other major stock out there with that sort of ludicrous PE. Even other tech stocks which are backed up earnings canâ€™t meet the same PEs making Teslaâ€™s current valuation for the birds.

Iâ€™m not sure it will drop 10 times as the firm was been good a trimming costs, but agree that a big drop makes a huge amount of sense even if you put aside the Musk brand toxicity.

Considering we are entering dangerous territory economically right now with a correction all but certain (just look at the crazy treasury yields right now), markets are going to push for more realistic numbers.

To balance this post out a bit more, I would argue that my points above also apply to firms such as Apple, Meta, etc.

Also AI is definitely in full hype phase where the promises are not being met by reality. If anyone plays with the models at the moment, you will know the utility is fairly low. Will that improve, yes, but it will take more time than we expect. The same goes for technologies like FSD. Regulators exist for a reason - to protect citizens and their lives. Even if DOGE shutters elements stalling FSD, no other major regulator in Europe or Asia will be prepared to take the same approach.

post,"Grokâ€™s opinion
Put 2 prompts into grok
1. Is investing in tesla a good idea right now it looks cheap compared to previous prices but online i read a lot of negative sentiment.

2. In the s&p500 what stock today is the best deal, having good earnings outlook and not at a high valuation.

Answer 1.

Deciding whether to invest in Tesla (TSLA) right now involves weighing its current price against its historical highs, the negative sentiment youâ€™ve noticed online, and the broader context of its fundamentals and future potential. Letâ€™s break this down.

Teslaâ€™s stock price has indeed dropped from its peak. In late 2024, it hit a record high above $480, but as of early March 2025, itâ€™s trading closer to $272 (based on recent web data). Compared to that peak, itâ€™s down over 40%, which might make it seem ""cheap"" relative to where it was. Historically, Tesla has experienced sharp swingsâ€”its 52-week range spans from about $152 to $488â€”so the current price sits in the middle, not at a clear bargain-basement level but certainly below its highs.

The negative sentiment youâ€™re seeing online isnâ€™t baseless. Recent reports highlight challenges: Teslaâ€™s EV sales in 2024 declined by 1% year-over-year, the first drop since 2011, amid rising competition from companies like BYD and softening global demand for electric vehicles. Sales in key markets like China (down 49% in February 2025) and Scandinavia (down over 40%) have tanked, partly due to pricing pressures and consumer backlash tied to Elon Muskâ€™s political activities. Analysts have cut price targetsâ€”Bank of America recently slashed theirs from $490 to $380â€”citing tariff risks and weaker fundamentals. Some, like Guggenheim, even predict a potential 40% plunge within a year if growth doesnâ€™t rebound. This bearish chatter reflects real concerns about near-term earnings, especially since EVs still drive 78% of Teslaâ€™s revenue.

On the flip side, Teslaâ€™s bulls argue the negativity is overblown. Morgan Stanley recently named it a ""Top Pick,"" predicting a rebound, while Wedbushâ€™s Dan Ives sees a $550 target (a 100%+ upside) based on long-term catalysts like Full Self-Driving (FSD), robotics (Optimus), and new models like the Model Y Juniper. Teslaâ€™s working on unsupervised FSD rollouts, Cybercab production by 2026, and a cheaper mass-market vehicle in mid-2025â€”moves that could reignite growth. Plus, its vertical integration and charging network give it an edge competitors struggle to match. Optimists like Cathie Wood project FSD alone could push Teslaâ€™s revenue to $1.2 trillion by 2029, dwarfing its 2024 haul of $97.6 billion.

Valuation-wise, Teslaâ€™s pricey. Even after the drop, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio hovers above 80, triple Nvidiaâ€™s and far above the Nasdaq 100â€™s average. A 50% further decline, as some bears suggest, would still leave it at a P/E of 40â€”hardly ""cheap"" unless earnings surge. Analystsâ€™ consensus target is around $320, suggesting modest upside from $272, but the range is wild ($24.86 to $550), reflecting deep uncertainty.

Sentiment onlineâ€”on forums like Reddit or Xâ€”leans mixed. Some investors see a buying opportunity, pointing to Teslaâ€™s innovation pipeline; others warn of a sinking ship as Muskâ€™s focus splits toward DOGE and political controversies alienate buyers. The average analyst rating is ""Hold,"" with 36 tracked: roughly a third say Buy, a third Hold, and a third Sell. Thatâ€™s a stalemate, not a ringing endorsement.

So, is it a good idea? It depends on you. If youâ€™re a long-term believer in Teslaâ€™s tech vision and can stomach volatility, the current dip might look appealingâ€”especially if you think FSD and robotics will pay off big. But if youâ€™re rattled by the negative noise, weak 2025 sales trends, and a lofty valuation, waiting for clearer signs of a turnaround (or a deeper discount) might make sense. Either way, itâ€™s not a slam-dunk ""cheap"" buyâ€”more a high-stakes bet on an uncertain future. Whatâ€™s your risk tolerance, and how long are you willing to hold? Thatâ€™s the real decider here.

Answer 2. 

To identify the best deal in the S&P 500 todayâ€”March 5, 2025â€”with a good earnings outlook and a low valuation, we need a stock that balances a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, strong projected earnings growth, and a price not inflated by market hype. Based on current market conditions and available data, **General Motors (GM)** stands out as a compelling candidate.

As of early March 2025, GM trades around $52 per share, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 5.8. This is strikingly low compared to the S&P 500â€™s average forward P/E of 23.6, suggesting itâ€™s undervalued relative to the broader market. The stockâ€™s price-to-book (P/B) ratio is about 0.85, below 1.0, meaning it trades at a discount to its book valueâ€”another sign of a bargain. For context, tech-heavy S&P 500 names like Nvidia (forward P/E ~40) or Tesla (forward P/E ~80) carry valuations orders of magnitude higher, reflecting growth premiums GM doesnâ€™t demand.

Earnings outlook bolsters the case. Analysts expect GMâ€™s earnings per share (EPS) to grow from $9.66 in 2024 to $10.03 in 2025, a solid if unspectacular 3.8% increase, with some forecasts reaching $10.50 (8.7% growth) depending on EV and truck sales. Revenue is projected to rise from $182.1 billion in 2024 to $185.6 billion in 2025, up 1.9%. This growth isnâ€™t explosive, but itâ€™s reliable, driven by strong demand for GMâ€™s high-margin trucks (e.g., Silverado) and a recovering EV segment with models like the Equinox EV gaining traction. Q4 2024 results beat expectationsâ€”$3.06 EPS vs. $2.20 consensusâ€”showing resilience despite a 2.2% sales dip, thanks to pricing power and cost cuts. GMâ€™s guidance for 2025 targets $13.5-$15.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up from $13.9 billion in 2024, signaling confidence.

Why isnâ€™t it overvalued? GM lacks the speculative froth of AI or tech stocks. Its P/E has hovered below 10 for years, even as peers like Ford (forward P/E ~7) or Stellantis (~4) compete in the same space. Market sentiment has been lukewarmâ€”down 8% in the past month amid tariff worries and a broader auto sector pullbackâ€”but this dip enhances its â€œdealâ€ status. Analystsâ€™ consensus price target is $61, a 17% upside, with bulls like Wedbush ($96) citing EV potential and bears like UBS ($56) flagging competition. The stockâ€™s 48% gain over the past year trails the S&P 500â€™s 55%, keeping it off the radar of momentum chasers.

Risks exist: EV adoption hiccups, potential tariffs under Trumpâ€™s administration, and a softening consumer could hit margins. But GMâ€™s $19 billion cash pile, low debt-to-equity (0.33), and 0.92% dividend yield (recently hiked) provide a buffer. Compared to alternativesâ€”say, ExxonMobil (forward P/E 11, slower growth) or Bank of America (forward P/E 12, rate-sensitive)â€”GM offers a rare mix of value, stability, and upside in todayâ€™s pricey market. Itâ€™s not flashy, but itâ€™s the best deal fitting your criteria right now.

comment,"67% of all Teslas sold are the Model Y.  

Some facts: 1) Tesla started 2025 with almost no Model Y's unsold in inventory. 2) In early January Tesla announced a new version of the Model Y (Juniper) to be released in March. Naturally, due to the Osborne Effect, orders of the old Model Y were reduced as people held out for the new version. 3) Starting in mid-to-late January production of the old Model Y was ramped down in all 4 global factories simultaneously, including several days of zero production worldwide. 4) Factories remained on reduced production of the old, lower demand Model Y, through mid-February while orders for the Juniper piled up. 5) Production began (though at far from peak volumes) for the Model Y Juniper in mid-February, but Tesla remains far from peak production and has just this week started deliveries of the new Model Y.  6) Historically Tesla effectively sells every car they have made and have not been demand constrained.

Some speculation: By the end of March the new Model Y will be closer to full production and deliveries of the new Model Y will outstrip those of the old Model Y. Tesla will continue to sell every car they make.  If the Tesla Model Y doesn't maintain the title of best selling car in the world in 2025 (it was in both 2023 and 2024) it will only be by a hair due to 2 months of reduced production. The Model Y will easily recapture the title of best selling car in the world in 2026 and for years to come.",3/5/2025 13:27,baldwalrus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j41kp2/groks_opinion/,0.958,reddit

The implied vol is just 50-60%, you are trying to pocket a small premium on a collapsing stock. 

Tesla could well do another 50% drop easy.

In particular if you are selling calls which include Q1 25, the stock could do a crazy drop in one trading session. To try to pocket a premium which is what? Few % points of your notional?

If sales go down 20-30%, we could get 40-50% EPS cut easily.

I like Tesla and think Elonâ€™s effort in creating the company has been incredible.

However, his social media style has always been annoying. At one point, it made sense as a way to get free marketing, but then he bought Twitter, got red-pilled, and started believing in bullshit alt-right narratives.

Then he paid $288 million to help get Trump elected. Iâ€™m in Europe, and Putin has killed friends of people I know. Itâ€™s likely Elon made a deal with him. Elons lies on twitter are no longer annoying, they are an act of war.

I don't understand anything about how short squeezes have historically happened with other stocks, how timing can be influenced by large shareholders and other positions, thinking risk and opportunity.

There's a lot of interest in shorts now. You see an insider dump shares, ridiculous fundamentals, and IMHO as a compassionate person, the CEO's mental health crisis. But what if, in the midst of these fears, a whale dumps enough through institutions to trigger other institutional rule based sales, more retail fear sales, and at some point, lots of shorts and confident leveraged contracts. Why dump? Cause the whale hates shorters and is now unfettered and wants to create an amusing trap. So the knife drops in a market awash with supply. And then the whale institutions stop selling, start buying everything for sale, and then every short beyond that horizon will need to cover, and the stampede starts. So at some point, longs are lottery bargains. Can one make a better guess about that point by looking at options and other data? Am I thinking about any of this right?

Nissan - going bankrupt. Not a peep about that?

Two new models this year for Tesla. Very cheap units that nobody - gas or electric can compete with.

It created ridiculous following for hate and love on both sides where ironically many have inverted flipping sides not cause of the mission but because of Elonâ€™s antics and influence. 

The history of Tesla though is that itâ€™s an industry creator and the only company to have did what they did that deserves being in the same discussions as the mag seven which have all traded significantly above a realistic valuation for many years before their sales and earnings caught up to it. 

Moreover if Tesla didnâ€™t have so much hatred and shorts there wouldnâ€™t be ridiculou massive short squeezes when they actually get traction demonstrating to the world they can and do achieve goals they set out to like the staring their mission was to make sustainable transport a thing of the future back in 2004-2009",3/6/2025 15:02,rlovepalomar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j4vasg/why_are_you_here/,-0.2186,reddit

Fired up the cannons again â€“ adding another 30% TSLA at 240-265. Already in with 20% at 295. The charts are screaming we're near the end of this pullback.

SPX is coiling tight with multiple strong supports stacked between 5500-5750. This is exactly the kind of setup where markets unleash a face-melting rally. I'm calling it now: bottom forms in the next 2-3 weeks, and we launch toward 6200+ on SPX in the months ahead.

TSLA? Easy 400+ target on this next leg up.

comment,"Markets are forward-looking and rarely move based purely on trailing P/E multiples. If valuations alone dictated price action, low P/E stocks would consistently outperform, which empirical data disproves. Price is a function of liquidity, positioning, sentiment, and forward expectations. Declining sales and elevated P/E can coexist with a rally if the market begins pricing in an inflection point, macro tailwinds, or shifts in monetary policy. Historically, some of the strongest rallies occur in the face of weak fundamentals as smart money anticipates future recovery before it reflects in earnings

The reason it is worth more is because robotaxis can provide a service at half the cost of Uber or less with like 3x-10x the profit margin. The cars will pay themselves off in a year or 2.

The real value add btw is when Tesla robotaxis become so widespread that they begin to compete with public transit and even some car buying in general. Because why buy a car if a tesla robotaxi will take you there for half the price per mile and will do it on your schedule and you never need to worry about insurance or repairs or anything?

It's like how the iPhone originally disrupted the cell phone industry, but then moved to disrupt hard line phones and then even some of the digital camera market too. They're still phones, but they have features that are so good that it's pointless to buy a dedicated device for those featues. Sound familiar?

Robotaxis will be an absolute game changer for Tesla. Most bears even agree that robotaxis would be a crazy good business, they just don't think FSD will be ready within even 10 years or that by the time it comes out competitors would have already taken the market.

Amazon has closer to 1M hourly employees, which cost them $50B/year. That's just two companies.

comment,"To your unsubstantiated points:

*""Best selling car on the planet is under a revamp/refresh....""*

Global Tesla deliveries were only down 1% YOY 23 to 24 because of good 24 sales in China. [Growth has now fully reversed with Chinese car company BYD Feb 2025 China sales increasing 90% YOY from Feb 2024. During the same period Tesla China Feb sales fell a whopping 49% YOY from Feb 2024](https://futurism.com/tesla-sales-china). On a trailing annualized basis, Chinese sales are down 28.7% over the last 12 months. That has nothing to do with the ""refresh"" break. Teslaâ€™s Chinese sales rivaled US sales in 2024. With BYD and 200+ other Chinese EV manufacturers releasing lower cost models daily, Tesla's Chinese sales are in a free fall.

*""Checks notes - over 250K reservations already for the new Y,""*

Source?

*""Q1 sales are weak EVERYWHERE..."".*

Globally Tesla's sales are now in decline year over year. In regions where overall car sales are down, Tesla is down more. In regions where BEV sales are up, in the EU for instance, Tesla is down. [""This 45-percent decrease (in the EU, European Free Trade Association, and the United Kingdom), along with a reduction in market share from 1.8 percent to 1 percent, occurred despite battery electric vehicle sales rising by 34 percent over the same period.""](https://www.newsweek.com/tesla-worst-performing-markets-sales-plummet-2039788)

*""Ride-hailing (the value in the numbers) piloting in less than 90 days on hardware with a cost of 25K - nobody will be able to compete at those numbers. No company has that ability.""*

Competitors are already at cost parity with regular taxi/ride share. [Besides Waymo, which is up and running in multiple markets, there are at least 7 other companies who already entered the market, or will shortly.](https://productmint.com/waymo-competitors/) Considering Musk promised robotaxis by 2020, why do we believe his tech will be superior, more cost effective or even competitive when it finally arrives?

*""Robots in production this year - tech was demonstrated - will be piloting in factories*  
*by EOY.""*

Source that ""tech was demonstrated"". All we have ever seen is human remote controlled ""demos"".

Yes - vaporware. [Nine years ago Tesla's CEO promised that ""within two years it will be possible to remotely summon a Tesla from across the country"".](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/autonomous-driving/timeline-of-tesla-self-driving-aspirations-a9686689375/) He also claimed that every Tesla sold is capable of FSD with just software updates. [Yet on the last earnings call, while revealing a staggering 71% YOY drop in profits - Musk finally admitted what many suspected. Any chance of full self driving will require all but the very latest car's computer hardware to be completely replaced. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolekobie/2025/02/05/another-missed-prediction-musk-admits-teslas-need-full-self-driving-upgrades/)

[https://electrek.co/2025/03/05/tesla-to-build-a-new-megafactory-in-texas-near-houston/](https://electrek.co/2025/03/05/tesla-to-build-a-new-megafactory-in-texas-near-houston/)

In 2024, Tesla's Shanghai Megapack Factory generatedÂ $10.86 billionÂ in revenue, a 67% increase from the previous year.Â This made energy storage Tesla's most profitable business segment, with a higher gross margin than its automotive division.Â 

Analysts at RBC Capital believe Tesla's Megapack utility-grade battery storage business could be worth substantially more than its standalone car business. 

Tesla claims the world needs at least 2TWh of annual battery storage at scale, which analysts assume will be reached around 2040.

 ""This could yield $600B in annual industry revenues,"" analysts wrote. ""A 15% market share could mean at least $90B in Tesla-specific battery storage  
revenue."" 

""Applying a 15x cap goods EBITDA multiple results in a $345B EV for Tesla's Megapack business, and discounting this back to 2024 from 2040 results in a $120B valuation,"" analysts added.

With mineral deals in the works and Elon in favor with the Trump administration, we could see a lot more focus on megapack production. Bullish for the long term.",3/7/2025 2:34,tvcasualty1989,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j5d5vp/tesla_to_build_new_megafactory_in_texas_near/,0.8655,reddit

post,"Potential Scenarios and Implications for Tesla Call Options
Several potential scenarios could emerge from today's events, each with different implications for Tesla and corresponding call options:

The most favorable scenario for Tesla call holders would involve a moderately positive jobs report that supports economic growth without triggering inflation concerns, coupled with dovish commentary from Powell suggesting continued rate cut potential, and reassuring statements from Trump indicating flexibility on tariff implementation. This combination could reinvigorate risk appetite and potentially reverse Tesla's recent negative momentum.

A more challenging scenario would involve significantly stronger-than-expected employment data prompting concerns about delayed rate cuts, hawkish messaging from Powell emphasizing inflation vigilance, and doubling down on protectionist trade policies by Trump. This combination could exacerbate selling pressure across growth stocks, with Tesla potentially facing additional headwinds due to its international exposure.

Tesla's immediate trading direction will likely be established by the jobs report before market open, with Powell and Trump's speeches potentially reinforcing or reversing this initial trajectory. The stock's high beta characteristics suggest it could experience amplified reactions to broader market movements triggered by these events.",3/7/2025 5:13,Mediocre_Ninja6266,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j5g0x5/potential_scenarios_and_implications_for_tesla/,0.8953,reddit

When that happens TSLA is going to tank like there is no tomorrow because a CEO who is not paid and has no shares in the company has no reason to work for it. He knows this and has traded in the brand value of TSLA ( maga pivot) for political power and hopefully spacex contracts(mars project).

comment,"I never originally invested in TSLA. I invested in Solar City, which later became TSLA when they were acquired. Cost basis basically $15 per share. 

I believed in Solar City because I believed in renewable energy. I held TSLA for similar reasons. I contemplated selling before, but several years ago I saw Elon give an impassioned speech, and I fully believed that even though he might do things that were untraditional or controversial, that he truly believed in the company and would wholeheartedly back it, and I also believed that to disrupt an industry some level of bucking tradition is necessary. 

I sold my holdings several days ago for ~270. Iâ€™m not a conservative nor a Trump supporter, but I didnâ€™t sell because of Elonâ€™s politics. I also didnâ€™t sell because of his tendencies to overpromise. 

I sold because of two reasons. One is because Elon has become a massive brand risk. Whether or not I personally agree with his politics is irrelevant, Iâ€™m ultimately in stocks to make money. However, public perception has changed so much (particularly in Europe) that I donâ€™t foresee the business doing well on the future. 

Secondly, the stock at current levels prices in incredible future growth. I was willing to be along for the ride back when I believed Elon would fight tooth and nail to attempt to realize this growth. I no longer believe that he will do this.

Maybe one day the stock will hit the moon. But to be honest, Iâ€™ve made enough money already to put it into a safe, slow, and steadily growing company based on solid fundamentals rather than take a moonshot with someone Iâ€™ve lost a lot of confidence in.",3/7/2025 23:21,lobaway0001,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j60rld/price_hit_250s_are_you_still_in_the_stock/,0.9356,reddit

comment,"Depends when you got in. If you can take profit, take it. Because the stock is going to continue to go down (all things being equal, which they never are). 

This is about things that are hurting the companies ability to sell product. One of them is Elon : cars are status symbols, they â€˜say thingsâ€™ about the owner and Elon has shifted the narrative on that. A lot of people donâ€™t wanna be associated with that even if they have. I issues with Elon Musk. Technicals donâ€™t buy cars people do. 

But those things can change. The way it is now is not the way itâ€™s going to be. If you believe in the company, then believe the company will find a way out from under Elon because heâ€™s just not a good match for Tesla anymore.

I do believe that Tesla itself is a good company. I also think being free of someone who can force you to produce the cyber truck would be a gift from God. 

So thatâ€™s the kind of news Iâ€™m looking for: how are they getting rid of Elon?

I sold to take profit, when it was obvious to me the stock was going to free-fall when Tesla owners were getting their cars keyed. 

On the other hand, itâ€™s not just Elon. Itâ€™s also the market, itâ€™s tariffs itâ€™s also EV ( Trump wants to get rid of all the EV charging stations. Itâ€™s a little less of a sure thing that the government is not helping out at citizens to move to electric vehicles).

comment,"Twitter, the company has loans that are separate from Musk's trust fund.

I'm not sure how/why you are misconflating these two financial situations and obligation. 

Twitter doesn't own itself. 

Musk is one of several people who took it private, purchased the shares. 

He in fact did leverage Tesla shares for this one particular example. I am not sure what the other two examples are but seems likely there would be others.

It is common knowledge and proven that Musk sold a considerable number of shares shortly after purchasing twitter, due to the leveraged position, in which he was. This was around the time Tesla dropped to 110.

While business was already on a decline Muskâ€™s extreme antics and lack of any sense of responsibility towards the investors or customers and lack of focus as the CEO are massive red flags. We already said he was juggling too much 2 years ago and maybe itâ€™s time he gives way for a new CEO and he remains the Chairman at least for 1 or 2 companies while he leads the rest. He rather decided to go and buy out twitter and spend all his day on it. I donâ€™t want people to tell me that someone who sends or engages in 100-150 tweets per day, mostly trolling people and nothing related to the companies is still focussed or a good CEO. Heâ€™s openly told the companies business partners and customers alike to F off. And I didnâ€™t even mention the DOGE thing as this isnâ€™t about politics.

comment,"There are very few companies run by shiny white knights. Ford, Mercedes, Siemens, Hugo Boss, IBM, Volkswagen for example, were all supporters of Hitler and Siemens and IBM specifically helped organize the processing, tracking and killing of Jews. So far Tesla has managed to make an actual real difference in CO2 emissions and made the world actually consider a machine that doesnâ€™t burn fuel.

Elonâ€™s behaviour when compared to the rest of the vehicle manufacturers out there is more obvious, but far less insidious than theirs.

post,"How do TSLA holders view the Trump admin anti EV policies?
In Donald's address to Congress earlier this week he repeated the drill baby drill mantra, as well as calling for an end to EV mandates. Some have suggested such mandates don't exist and that could explain the lack of reaction on the latter. 

TSLA supporter's views are of interest, but in this circumstance so are Elon's. There he is applauding at the circus. I so wanted the camera to pan to him during either of comments above? Was he still applauding? 
Does he not have something to say when he clearly has the ear of Donald?

Does he still see rapid  EV adoption as part of the solution to environmental issues? 

Does he not see TSLA success tied to EV sales anymore?

I never heard of anyone saying that the post election rally was a â€œdipâ€. I personally donâ€™t see any negligence. How has Elon successfully managed several companies to date? Every time he does something new people complain that heâ€™s splitting his focus and his time. But Iâ€™m yet to see any of his business ventures outright fail. SpaceX- leader in rocket technology. xAI debatably a leader in LLM (I say debatably because that sector shifts day to day). Twitter/X- was in the red when he purchased it but heâ€™s since doubled its profits. Starlink is a leader in speed, latency, and market share. Sure, heâ€™s overly optimistic with timelines. But Tesla and Elon at large delivers on his goals.

comment,"These questions get asked daily on here. lol read the room for sure.

 I had this huge debate with an investor friend and I was on the side that EV is totally inevitable. He argued otherwise. It doesnâ€™t mean gas will be obsolete right away, it just means EV has been tried and tested and works for some people and some countries. Chinese being the main competitor. 

IMHO only reason tesla is what it is was today was mainly bc TAX bids and rebates without the govt support it was going bankrupt. Now if another country decides to back their own and do the same, Tesla is done for - for sure- being the leader. This is just my own analysis. 

I too wanted to see his reaction to that comment. I donâ€™t think EV is being supported by HIM like it was before ever since they announced removing the chargers in DC area. That gave me the vibe that heâ€™s moving away from tesla. Why? Idk idc either. 

I think his focus is getting bids for his other companies. As there is less competition. 

Either way heâ€™s lost my support and I would not invest in the stock nor the brand and I expect for awhile people wonâ€™t either EVEN if they were to remove him. The brand has been tarnished. It would take a very popular ceo to turn this ship around and gain consumer trust.

post,"The real Mother of all Trendlines
Bottom is in.

We just bounced off the Mother of all Trendlines, that started at the beginning of the long term (hopefully forever) uptrend on April 24, 2024 (big gap up after bad earnings report on April 23rdðŸ¤”). TSLA was on a long term downtrend before that date.

It also made a hammer candle on the daily and 4hr timeframe yesterday, a sign of a reversal.

This chart is 7am to 4pm market hours, which I found to be very accurate for trend lines.

Iâ€™m predicting a complete reversal. We might retest the MOAT or wick under it if Q2 deliveries come bad, but Iâ€™m not expecting the number to be as bad as most people think. 

Robotaxi in California and Texas soon, and unsupervised FSD in all Teslas should be released a few months after that in America and Canada. Imagine sending your car driverless to pick up a friend or a girl up, what a flex. Anyone selling now will regret it in 3-6 months IMO.
ï¿¼â€‹

Edit:

This is a weekly timeframe trend line.

Thereâ€™s been bad times when it wicks under the trendline (before shareholder meeting June 2024, Japan yen trade August 2024, before q3 2024 earnings when everyone was super bearish), but the weekly candle always closes above the trendline. This is one of those bad times for the whole market, and Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s transient like those other events. If the weekly candle closes above the trendline at ~254, then the uptrend is intact. If not, Iâ€™ll cut some losses and switch to sells until the weekly candle closes above the trend line.

comment,"This would have zero impact. Make that 0.0000000000 impact, just to be precise.

""Rare earth"" minerals actually are not rare. They're just minerals that have historically been used in such small quantities that no one has bothered to look for more deposits beyond the few we already exploit. 

Some of these minerals are used in making EVs, and we'll need more of them. But there's no reason to think Ukraine has more of them than anywhere else. Established mining countries like Chile and Australia have plenty and we'll probably just buy them from there with or without a Ukraine deal. We also have lots of deposits in the USA. 

Rare earths make up a tiny fraction of a car's price and they're sold to all manufacturers. So even if there is some massive new deposit in Ukraine, it would lead to only a miniscule drop in Tesla's costs AND that miniscule drop would be shared with all of Tesla's competitors. 

It means nothing for the stock. Nothing.",3/9/2025 6:53,sovietique,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j3xbwf/tesla_rare_earth_minerals_from_ukraine/,-0.4939,reddit

comment,"Tesla was 16.3% in the fourth quarter did you forget that company? They do nothing but battery electrics so basically Tesla is the leader percentage wise in battery electrics. The other car companies are including internal combustion engines, hybrids, and battery electrics. What percentage of their business is battery electrics I'll bet there are nowhere near 16.3%. just checked the numbers for general motors they did 12.4% battery electrics in year 2024. And Tesla is the new kid on the block, by the end of this year of 2025 their market share of electric vehicles will probably be above 28 PERCENT TO 30%. By the year 2030 I would think Tesla would be in the 40% market share area. I believe Hyundai and Kia , because of their better and longer warranties, will do better than the legacy automakers like general motors, Ford and stalantis in the United States by the year 2030, Tesla's share price by that time period will probably hover near $1,000 a share.and I believe they have a better product, let's see what happens.ðŸ¤”ðŸ‘ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸ›»",3/9/2025 7:34,SpiritedSpinach8882,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j6k606/how_do_tsla_holders_view_the_trump_admin_anti_ev/,0.9636,reddit

I canâ€™t quote my source so no one will believe me, but Apple is notoriously secretive about what theyâ€™re doing and I am 100% sure they have a robot deep in the pipeline. Even if TSLA is publicly ahead, this is not really an area where they have some huge data advantage like they had with FSD and all their cars on the road that no one else has. Apple is more than capable of collecting the necessary data and training a bot with all of their resources. They can outsource the manufacturing effectively just like they do with their other products, itâ€™s more difficult than phones but less difficult than cars. They also now have the advantage that an official of the federal government (Elon) will not have his eyes and ears inside your home. I am already uneasy about continuing to drive my model X, there is absolutely no way I am putting a Tesla Bot in my home if Elon has any association with that product.

comment,"It's clear now that Tesla hype is coming to a close. It should go back to a reasonable P/E of $40-50 share if you are pricing in growth, so maybe lower as car sales (79% of revenue) continue to drop. That means Tesla should be priced about $100 per share as of now, so I expect it to go much lower than $240 over time.

comment,"It's fairly obvious to everyone (or it should be) that Tesla is way overvalued, with an enormous P/E ratio. The crash is going to be quite substantial, even if the share price goes to 2x that of Toyota's market cap. FSD is a solid tech, and the robotics side of things could be interesting, but there is solid competition in both areas, especially from China. These do not justify the current valuation, even after the recent drops. Not even close. Even if the robotaxi idea worked from tomorrow, how long before a competitor came up with a product that matches or exceeds that capability?

They're valued like a tech company but they aren't selling a service or software.  They've seen an unprecedented loss of sales and they can't just lay off developers to weather the storm they're experiencing.  Their manufacturing facilities and unsold inventory are expensive, and are going to be extremely expensive to maintain.  Without a customer base for their bread and butter product for the foreseeable future, and frankly those debts may stack up and run them entirely dry before any of the products supposedly in the pipeline come to fruition.

We'll sooner $30 than $300 at this rate.  I'd caution against trying to call the bottom, because one frankly may not exist.  Those who lived through the dotcom bubble have seen stock movement like this before.   You can draw lines on a charts to support any prediction you want.  End of the day, there's a real company behind the data that needs to remain solvent, and that's a whole hell of a lot more important.",3/10/2025 14:21,Weebus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j7zblk/seems_that_the_250_support_broke_but_we_are_firm/,-0.486,reddit

If that proves to be the case, Tesla stock could be facing further downside of 50% or more over the next 12 months. It would have to decline more than 70% just for its P/E ratio to trade in line with Nvidia, which is one of the fastest-growing large-cap companies in the world.

comment,"I sold all of my 350 shares over the past year as Elon has become more unhinged. Have been an investor in the company since 2014. Its called 'key man risk' in investing. When one person becomes too associated with a brand it can be a benefit, as it was, or a massive detriment, as it has become. There is a documentary from 2015-2016 on youtube called Bloomberg Game Changers - Elon Musk. Watch it. In that documentary Elon says twice that he almost had a nervous breakdown trying to run Tesla when they almost went bankrupt in 2008. Now take that level of stress, add what, 6 more companies? He also has been paying people to play video games for him, made fake accounts on X to compliment his primary account, denied both of these things, then admitted to them. And now he is in charge of a brand new government agency, running around on stages with chain saws screaming, naming his 11th and 12th kids Techno Mechanicus, and **X Ã† A-12,** and throwing up Sieg Heils on stage after donating 150 million dollars to a campaign 6 months after vowing he would not donate to any campaign. If you feel safe in investing in a company run by that guy, then you deserve to lose your money. I have been playing this game for a long time and I have never seen so much brand destruction be done in such a short amount of time. Quite frankly, its astonishing, but not entirely unpredictable.

Compare the two companies:

2020 Tesla was growing massively, had a hot model, had zero competition in EV, and were generally beloved.  Full FSD was on the horizon.   They were sold out months in advance.

2025 Tesla is losing revenue at a staggering ate.  They've released one model since which is proving to be a major flop.  The market is flooded with competition while their models are dated.

comment,"What part of ""robotaxi"" seems promising? 

1. You're required to place your hands when using FSD on your tesla, probably for liability reason cause it's too garbage to be a real FSD(idk why people accept such a dumb name  that works nothing like that in the real world).

2. Tesla uses Camera for their FSD because it's cheaper and that's all. Waymo uses cameras, lidar and radar for the vision for their self driving.

3. Muskraat has promised a lot of shits just to pump the stock and a lot of it ended up not being true...Ex: ""**Musk claimed FSD would be â€œfeature completeâ€ by the end of the year**."" this was in 2020. 

2019: Musk predicted that Tesla would have over a million robotaxis on the road by mid-2020.

2023: Musk admitted his previous timelines were overly optimistic but promised full autonomy â€œlater this year.â€

comment,">Tesla is too late

Is there really a ""too late"" when it comes to taxi services though?

When I travel, I use Uber and Lyft and just select whichever one can pick me up first. Or I'll even opt for a shuttle or airport taxi/limo/whatever, depending on the price.

I don't think that the concept of ""first to market always wins"" really applies to all businesses/areas.

Just another example: Facebook was huge... But then Twitter came along and got massively popular... And Reddit, and TikTok and Instagram, etc.

People like choice.

But all of that being said... For self-driving taxis, some people may opt to always stick to the *quickest* ride. Some might opt for the *cheapest* ride. Some might opt for the *fanciest* ride. Some (me) might even just stick to what has been proven to be the *safest* ride.

And as far as I understand it, that is definitely Waymo.",3/10/2025 16:17,maester_t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j80cw8/robotaxis/,0.8462,reddit

comment,"I bought in 2023 trough!

Here's the difference:

\- Cybertruck was primed to take on the largest consumer segment of American vehicles

\- Semi was primed to take on the largest commercial segment of American transport

\- in general, sales were still geometrically possible for electrification of just consumer transport in general

\- Tesla had marked advantages in scale and production/margin

\- competition was basically just in prototype phases.

\- Musk was disliked because of Twitter, but generally his erratic behavior was firewalled from Tesla

\- Tesla was a great brand with deeply passionate owners and huge media impact. It didn't even need a marketing department.

Now?

\- Cybertruck is a total failure, and even fixing its engineering and production issues won't save it. It is the new Edsel

\- The Semi is still in prototype, and may require solid state or fundamentally better densities to be viable, and the infrastructure is still effectively zero

\- sales are collapsed by 50% in major markets, and US impacts are still unknown, but likely quite bad as well. The prospect for future sales in the next 1-2 years is incremental or flat AT BEST. 

\- The only way it can get sales is MASSIVE price cuts to get into the range of apolitical mass market drivers, and even then that requires overcoming ""the rebellion""

\- Competition is here, and arguably better in China/EU with chinese EVs. tariffs will only keep the chinese EVs from the US at bay for a while. 

\- Musk is reviled worldwide, and continues to bury himself publicly on a daily basis

\- Tesla the brand is dead. Its owners are embarrassed, retreating to other brands. Only zealots remain, and there is no pool of untapped customers to replace them.  Tesla the company has no internal competencies to repair its brand, and is unwilling to eject Musk as a first step to repairing the brand.",3/10/2025 16:44,cowardlydragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j802ci/those_holding_how_are_you_coping_with_the_dump_do/,0.5015,reddit

comment,"My cost basis is like $18 a share and I sold when it initially 10xâ€™d to recoup my cost basis and let the rest ride. When I first started buying shares, the stock was volatile except it had legitimate financial concerns, ie bankruptcy was certainly possible. Despite Elons political antics, I think the company is better positioned than ever (strong balance sheet, consistent positive FCF, several growth catalysts) and I actually started buying again when Tesla hit the low 100s. Did not expect it to rip up the way it did after the election so I stopped buying and just let it ride again. Iâ€™m hoping the price keeps dropping cause Iâ€™d like to buy more shares. I think the margin of safety is not great even with the recent sell off, it would not shock me to drop another 50% from here. 

I think people should not invest in Tesla if they do not think FSD/robotaxi is feasible. If you donâ€™t believe in this technology, you essentially have no argument for the valuation. I also donâ€™t think you should invest in Tesla if you canâ€™t handle these enormous swings from an emotional or financial perspective. If you want the gains, youâ€™re gonna have to buy and hold, because for the life of me, I can never predict when itâ€™s going to gap up or down even after seeing it happen over and over. I also donâ€™t think you should invest in Tesla unless youâ€™re willing to wait 5-10 years to see how things play out.",3/10/2025 17:04,Graphvshosedisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j802ci/those_holding_how_are_you_coping_with_the_dump_do/,0.9633,reddit

To quote Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley,

""Teslaâ€™s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive â€˜pure playâ€™ to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,"" 

""As we continue our analysis of the overlap of AI and robotics, it is increasingly clear to us that the commercial opportunity of non-auto expressions of embodied AI is likely far larger and faster-adopting than that of autonomous cars,""

Wall Street is completely blind to the explosive growth potential of ""embodied AI."" Also, don't look at all other AI companiesâ€”only Tesla has the capability to execute this vision

comment,"People should look at that tunnel and remember what was promised, the excuses and failed deadlines... They originally were selling the idea of a hyper efficient multi-modal cart system, they dropped the pneumatic idea and then the cart idea and then everything else until they had a drainage tunnel sized hole that a human driver takes you through in the least efficient and sensible way possible. They're not even good at digging tunnels, they're getting endless osha violations and warnings while still being slow and expensive. 

This project is eating money and it's not even a little bit impressive, using tesla cars makes so little sense that it must be embarrassing for the people who actually designed it and were forced to meet elons insane plan. 

Sure we can pretend that it'll look less bad when cybercab comes out and maybe they will work autonomously in the tunnels finally, so assuming all that the best case is several years from now they might have managed to make a small tunnel loop in Vegas that's only a bit worse than anything else.

comment,"One thing I think about the robotaxis is that, even saying that Tesla got them off the ground and they were perfect and ran great, they'd still need to be licensed by the states and localities where Musk wanted them to operate.

I'd guess that it's much more likely that the approval process, whatever it is, gets dragged out infinitely and the robotaxis (again, assuming that they actually work) lose money rather than make it.

Elon is an absentee CEO who spends most of his time on twitter actively working to burn his own brand to the ground.

comment,"Cyber trucks are overpriced lemons so that's a bad example.   USPS just needs an oversized hatchback and probably only 100 miles of range.  Probably just build it with 150 miles of range so it is still sufficient  even after dropping to 80% capacity.   Also probably better to focus on a 10 kW L2 charger rather than a 150 kW+ fast charger....450 kW supply can simultaneously charge 30 USPS trucks instead of just 3.   

 A 60 kW fast charger would be 1 kWh per minute or about 4 miles of range.    A 3 to 5 minute fast charge is probably enough for 1 day's route in a city for any USPS vehicle that didn't get an overnight L2 charge to full.  If adding a 100 kW or 150+ kW charger doesn't add much to the cost, then sure, go ahead, but USPS would be buying 1000s of these vehicles.

Also, USPS trucks can get away with a boxy roof.   If you can fit 1 to 2 kW of solar panels on the roof, it is possible the vehicle never needs to be charged.    1.5 kW x 5 hours of sun (average over the year, more during summer, less during winter), that's 7.5 kWh per day or about 30 miles.   Even just 1 kW of solar is 20 miles of range.    This would also let you get away with a smaller battery",3/10/2025 19:13,InternetRando12345,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ixxdnk/why_is_tsla_going_down_if_he_has_power_in_the_us/,0.3096,reddit

comment,"people are either fully immersed in the elon bubble or crazy to believe Tesla can ship robotaxis and its robotic businesses. 

Waymo is way ahead and already operational while working with one of the largest ride hailing app (Uber) and itâ€™s only going to get bigger, and optimusâ€¦ seems like a cool tech but already has many forerunners with proven tech.

So if Tesla is a robotaxi and robotic company, not a car companyâ€¦ what competitive edge do that have considering the crazy valuation they are at rn?",3/10/2025 19:29,Horsehhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j80cw8/robotaxis/,-0.09,reddit

comment,RIVN is in a similar position to TSLA before TSLA went up 1000%. Just hit their first profit and are positioned for lots of growth. Might be a good idea to trade from TSLA for RIVN at this point. I don't think TSLA is doomed or anything but their growth years are behind them. Even after the drop their market cap is 2.5x Toyota and they're already selling millions of cars. Doesn't seem like TSLA can double revenue in the short term but RIVN could 10x revenue as they follow in TSLA footsteps.,3/10/2025 19:29,emperioreric,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j802ci/those_holding_how_are_you_coping_with_the_dump_do/,0.0477,reddit

their headstart is blown and BYD will be selling more cars annually than Tesla has ever.

comment,"Gonna drop some info to help you in your decision making as someone working in the AV industry.

There are multiple US companies in this game backed by larger companies than Tesla. They consider the Tesla stack the best L2 system out there hands down (literally) itâ€™s also a meme in the industry when they talk about a real robotaxi deployment.

Their â€œtaxiâ€ service will have a safety driver. Theyâ€™re running a testing fleet and allowing people to ride while they test. Other companies have had this for 5-10 years minus allowing the public in bc weâ€™re not worried about a stock pump.

These AI stacks can pretty much do everything Tesla can do. Operate without mapped data. They have been validated in a safety case to be able to completely lose mapping and still drive. They actually create the maps on the fly and can drive with them and or update the fleet.

They can drive on camera only too (with radar) or lidar only. The reason for both is to build that .9999 safety case for unpredictable errors in the sensors. Mechanical issues dropping lidar points, wiring issues delaying or dropping camera images, miscalibration, etc

The failures which break a company you will basically never run into on your Tesla system even if you use it all day every day. You run into these on large fleet sizes driving 100s of miles a day. In fact you can design your system to appear as if itâ€™s a better driver if you rely on the human to take over the edge case disengagements. The real driverless systems are tuned so tightly to accommodate for the extreme edge cases that they get false positives that make the driving seem abnormal or poor. But itâ€™s required to save your life or more likely the life of a child falling into the street, the dog running under your car, the motorcyclist at night with a faulty headlight, the slow grandma still in the intersection while the sun angle that occludes your cameras so you miss her.

IMO the only reason the stock might survive the â€œrobotaxiâ€ deployment this year is if there are enough people who make irrational decisions to keep on buying the stock. Totally possible itâ€™s partly how it got so high anyway. 

Anyway good luck if you can lose 3M then life will be alright whatever your decision ;)",3/10/2025 20:04,weelamb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j802ci/those_holding_how_are_you_coping_with_the_dump_do/,0.907,reddit

However aside from that, Tesla has some serious issues. They aren't close to a commercially viable L4 autonomous driving system. The system design they chose isn't likely to ever be capable of it, even if they replace all computers they finally acknowledged are not capable. The whole system design has left them at the back of the pack if not completely out of the race. 

Ya think those Tesla robots are gonna get launched ""next year""? They have been promising L4 autonomous driving ""next year"" for 11 years now.

post,"Trump just advertised buying a Tesla
If you had told me even just 1 year ago if I thought it were possible for Trump to advertise buying a Tesla, or literally any EV, I would've said you were crazy. But here we are.

Today Trump apparently posted on truth social saying that in order to stand with Elon against unjust attacks he would be buying a Tesla. I don't think people realize how massive this is.

Tesla's mission is to transition the world to renewable energy. Well, how do you do that if half the country stubbornly mostly does not want to even consider buying an EV? That, I think, is likely much less of a problem now than it was yesterday.

This isn't just bullish for Tesla, this is a huge win for environmentalism. We need conservatives to buy EVs, we can't just pretend that half the country doesn't exist when trying to solve this problem after all, and I stand by the fact that Elon really has been the only one seriously trying to market EVs to conservatives. And now all that effort has paid off.

I think every argument about Trump being bad for EVs and environmentalism is now turned on its head. If Trump is telling people ""I bought a tesla because it was the right thing to do"" then even though he supports increasing fossil fuel production he is helping popularize Tesla and in the longer term that means significantly more profits for Tesla, which means more grid battery production, which means grid-scale renewable energy becomes much more cost competitive with gas. And we all know that once solar panels and batteries get cheap enough they could easily replace coal and gas as our primary source of electricity in this country. Too many advantages to ignore (virtual powerplants, gridless homes, stable electricity networks, easily scalable power plants, low risk working environments, etc.).

Sure the economy is shitting the bed right now but once Trump is done with his trade war it will eventually return to normal. And at THAT time, that is when we will see the main benefits of what has just happened. The future is very bright!!!

post,"Musk launches appeal to restore $56 billion Tesla payday
WILMINGTON, Delaware, March 11 (Reuters) - Elon Musk kicked off his appeal to try to restore his $56 billion payday from Tesla on Tuesday, claiming a lower court judge made multiple legal errors in rescinding the record compensation.
The 2018 pay package resulted in spectacular growth for the electric vehicle maker and yet it was determined by the lower Court of Chancery to be unfair to shareholders, who voted twice to approve the plan, Musk argued.

""That counterintuitive result defies settled principles of Delaware law, sound corporate governance, and common sense,"" said the opening appeal brief by Musk and the current and former Tesla directors who are defendants in the case.
In January 2024, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick rescinded the pay package of stock options, calling it ""unfathomable."" She said it was unfair to Tesla shareholders because the directors who approved it were beholden to Musk and Tesla withheld key information from investors before they voted to approve it.

In June, Tesla got shareholder approval for the pay package for a second time, but the judge rejected that as grounds for reversing her ruling.
The pay package had awarded Musk options to buy around 303 million Tesla shares at around $23 each if the company hit performance and valuation goals. Tesla stock closed Tuesday at $230.58.
Tesla has said creating a new pay package of similar value could result in a charge of $25 billion, making the appeal an important avenue for restoring Musk's compensation and keeping his attention on Tesla.

Musk has said that he wants a greater stake in Tesla or he might develop products outside of the company. The appeal comes as he is dedicating time to President Donald Trump's government efficiency effort, known as DOGE, which has sparked demonstrations outside Tesla dealerships. The stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks.
In the appeal brief, Musk and the other defendants said McCormick wrongly applied a very difficult legal standard known as entire fairness to assess the pay package.

She arrived at that standard by finding Musk, who owned 21.9% of the stock at the time the board approved the pay package, controlled the pay negotiations, according to the brief. In addition, she wrongly determined that ordinary business relationships among directors made them conflicted and she erroneously faulted Tesla's disclosures ahead of the 2018 shareholder vote, according to the brief.

Applying the entire fairness standard amounted to granting a ""license to sue"" to Tesla shareholders, the brief said. The lawsuit was brought by Richard Tornetta, a Tesla investor who owned nine shares when he filed the case in 2018. The lawsuit benefits Tesla, not Tornetta, in what is known as a derivative suit.

Musk blasted the pay decision and has encouraged other companies to follow Tesla and SpaceX and reincorporate out of Delaware. A handful have left the state or said they might, including Meta Platforms, opens new tab(META.O), opens new tab, TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), opens new tab and Trump's media company.

Fears that a trickle of companies will turn into a stampede, which has been dubbed ""DExit,"" prompted the state's legislature to consider amending its corporate law to better protect controlling shareholders from lawsuits.",3/12/2025 9:57,TrumpIsWeird,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j9gimo/musk_launches_appeal_to_restore_56_billion_tesla/,0.9469,reddit

comment,"Tesla is a publicly traded company and is now associated with Trump like never before. If sales drop further and robotaxis are delayed as the CEO is busy, why will it not continue to drop. Not only do you have its p/e ratio rising, but you got shareholders disillusioned with the company. I think it still has another 100-300 billion it can shave off its market cap. Any continuation of its stock price rising is algos doing their jobs. Whole market is up today, and tesla appears more leveraged than any other major stock today. If a red day was to come, say Friday, it again will have the largest percentage drop compared to the other big tech stocks. Leveraged stocks are not fun during economic uncertainties",3/12/2025 18:13,Loufrancisbacon,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j9k4kq/where_they_at/,-0.9319,reddit
comment,"President Donald Trump has pledged to prosecute anyone who vandalizes Tesla property as domestic terrorists, warning that his administration will crack down on those targeting the company. Speaking from the White House lawn with Elon Musk by his side, Trump defended Tesla as â€œa great American companyâ€ and said law enforcement is already tracking potential offenders.

Tesla has become a focal point for anti-Musk protests due to his financial support of Trumpâ€™s campaign and his unofficial advisory role in cutting federal spending. Some demonstrations have escalated into vandalism, with Tesla Superchargers, showrooms, and vehicles being targeted. One individual, reportedly motivated by Muskâ€™s controversial views, has already been arrested in Colorado.

While Trumpâ€™s stance signals an aggressive approach, legal experts highlight a lack of a specific federal statute for prosecuting domestic terrorism in cases of property destruction. This raises questions about how prosecutors will pursue such cases under existing laws. The debate over domestic terrorism laws has been ongoing, especially following major violent incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing and the Tree of Life synagogue attack.

Trumpâ€™s announcement underscores his administrationâ€™s commitment to protecting Muskâ€™s business interests, further solidifying their close political and financial ties.

comment,I believe the Board of Directors at Tesla is selling large quantities of shares ahead of Elon making an attempt to take Tesla private again. A depressed stock value could make it easier to get financing and his personal wealth has increased significantly. Thatâ€™s the only thing I could think of that would allow the stock compensation team at Tesla to approve all of these stock sales. Itâ€™s most likely a blackout period for investors now due to Q1 financial filing deadlines. Leadership of a large public company canâ€™t just make a sale like this without preauthorization. Elon knew ahead of their sale that these large stock sales were going to transpire. Thinking bigger picture it would make sense why he had the disastrous interview a few days ago about how hard running his other companies was too.

You can hope that the PR storm dies down and the anti-Tesla sentiment wanes, but I don't see that happening unless Musk gets his sorry ass out of the spotlight (which he shows absolutely no signs of doing). And if China is any indication the Juniper isn't going to save you, so you're looking at barrage after barrage of bad news, at least until next January. 

The only thing that's going to create an upward trend is a succesful launch of FSD or robotaxies, which yes, have been projected in 3-6 months.... by Elon Musk. So it could be 6 months, could be 12 months, could be Q3 of 2031 or never.

comment,"Completely agree. Low sales were clearly because of Tesla producing fewer cars due to the new Y retooling as well as not many people wanting to buy an old Y right before the new one comes out.

Tesla would have been completely fine imo once production of the model Y got back up to 100% in 1 or 2 months, with robotaxis coming in June, however this latest publicity stunt by Trump is a GAME CHANGER.

I've been waiting for something like this for years. Finally someone is actually making a serious, real effort to market EVs to conservatives! This would always have had to have happened eventually, because you can't transition the world to renewables with only half the country participating. However did I expect trump to do a complete 180 on EVs by not only endorsing Tesla on social media but also holding a press conference with all Tesla models where he picked out which one he was going to buy and said how awesome they were??? Hell no, not in a million years. This is insane.

I'm seeing on X now tons of conservatives who would never have bought an EV previously saying they just ordered a Tesla to show support for Elon/Tesla against the vandalism. That is MASSIVE. When production returns to normal I expect Tesla will have 1.5x to 2x the demand they usually have. 2025 is going to be a crazy year for Tesla sale (and of course robotaxis in June)!",3/12/2025 22:22,Vibraniumguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j9vty8/appealing_to_a_new_market/,-0.6975,reddit

comment,"I don't think so. A significant portion of the EV market is boycotting Tesla worldwide. The disdain for the company and its CEO is evident. The president's endorsement feels like another blow because many people donâ€™t want to associate with him either.

If we set aside the emotional aspects and focus on the company's accomplishments, there really aren't any. The most recent model, the Cybertruck, was launched last year and turned out to be a global disaster. Even Elon has acknowledged this, saying, ""Yeah, we dug a hole with the Cybertruck"" during an investor meeting.

Looking ahead, there arenâ€™t any new models on the horizon. The only thing to anticipate is the Tesla cab, or whatever it's called, which is expected to arrive in 2026, according to Elon. Additionally, nothing from Elon ever seems to arrive on schedule.

My question is, do you genuinely believe the masses are excited about a double-seater car without a steering wheel? While Full Self-Driving (FSD) is definitely improving, are people willing to risk their lives trusting it?

SpaceX hasn't made any progress either. The last two flights were disasters, and they are significantly behind schedule for the Artemis program.

comment,"I think the down trend just started and itâ€™s more likely to go down once the earnings report is released and the full extent of the numbers are absorbed. In addition, long term, the brand has been hurt significantly. 

I own a Tesla and would NEVER purchase another one again, or any product tied to Musk. These issues arenâ€™t going away even if Musk were to be ousted out of his position, due to his ownership of a significant percentage of Tesla shares and the ties heâ€™d have even if not the CEO. 

Moreover, the overall market is inflated. In addition, Tesla itself is one of the most overvalued major companies. It has a P/E ratio north of 100. It could easily be half the share price it is today and still be considered overpriced for a company whose brand is in the toilet and car sales are diminishing with a large amount of fixed costs and factories. 

I may be wrong. I may be right. I sold my shares last year after holding them since 2013. I just donâ€™t see a good outcome for this company. I also donâ€™t care to support Tesla anymore, unfortunately. Good luck to you though.",3/13/2025 6:56,Michael_Crichton,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j8vdfx/just_bought_tsla/,0.9274,reddit

comment,"Tesla is highly volatile. It goes up, then comes down, then goes up higher, and comes down less.  Look at a five year chart. We're at the bottom of a pullback. It's the worst time to sell, unless you want your learning curve to be the school of hard knocks.  Sentiment is always high while it's going up, and you'll want to buy when it's high, and sentiment is down when it's going down and you'll want to sell.  If you bought for a quick profit, you're not investing, you're gambling.

post,"Can someone help me understand this?
On 11/7/24 I bought 101 shares of Tesla at 293. Then on 12/11/24 I bought another 24 shares for 409. Then musk did musk things and the stock started crashing so I sold all of it for 322 on 2/25/25. Then just yesterday on 3/12/25 I bought 161 for 250. I thought that was a solid buy back in price even if in the short term it crashes a bit but when I checked today it said that the price paid was 262 and then I realized it was because of something called a wash sale which I kind of understand what it is now but still doesnâ€™t make sense to me because I never sold for a realized loss it was all for gain.

The SEC does not allow you to buy the stock cheaper for 30(/32?) days at a lower price than you originally bought it at (300) for a cost basis at your new lower price. Itâ€™s just an SEC law for us peasants.
